<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FLOWERS!</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Patty, do come along and get your
luncheon before everything grows
cold!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And the stars are old, And the leaves of the
judgment book unfold,&#8217;&#8221; chanted Patty, who
had just learned this new song, and was apt to
sing it at unexpected moments. She sat on the
floor in the middle of the long drawing-room
of her New York home. To say she was surrounded
by flowers, faintly expresses it. She
was hemmed in, barricaded, nearly smothered
in flowers.
</p>
<p>They were or had been in enormous florist&#8217;s
boxes, and as fast as Patty opened the boxes
and read the cards which accompanied the blossoms,
Jane took the boxes away.
</p>
<p>It was the great occasion of Patty&#8217;s début, and
in accordance with the social custom, all her
friends had sent her flowers as a message of
congratulation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have heaps of friends,&#8221; said
Elise, who was helping arrange the bouquets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; cried Patty; &#8220;nobody could have
as many friends as this! These flowers must
be also from my enemies, my casual acquaintances,
and indeed from utter strangers! I think
the whole hilarious populace of New York has
gone mad on the subject of sending flowers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as she spoke, Jane came in with several
more boxes, followed by Miller, fairly staggering
under an enormous box that was almost
too much for one man to carry. Behind him
was Nan, who went straight to Patty and held
out both hands to assist her to rise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t come out this
minute, you never <i>can</i> get out! A few more
of these boxes, and the door will be completely
blocked up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Nan,&#8221; and Patty scrambled to
her feet. &#8220;Come on, girls, let&#8217;s gather our
foodings while we may. These flowers will
keep; but I shudder to think of the accumulation
when we come back from luncheon!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there were so many flowers
in the world,&#8221; said Mona Galbraith, who
paused to look back into the drawing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty solemnly; &#8220;it&#8217;s an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
optical illusion. Don&#8217;t you know how the Indian
jugglers make you see flowers growing,
when there aren&#8217;t any flowers there? Well,
this is like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Following Nan, Patty&#8217;s pretty stepmother, the
three girls, arm in arm, danced along to the
dining-room, quite hungry enough to do justice
to the tempting luncheon they found there.
</p>
<p>All the morning they had been untying the
flower boxes and making a list of the donors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of the notes of thanks I have to
write,&#8221; said Patty, groaning at the outlook.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish we could help you,&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;but
I suppose you have to do those yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and I think it will take me the rest of
my natural life! What&#8217;s the use of &#8216;coming
out,&#8217; if I have got to go right in again, and write
all those notes? Why, there are hundreds!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thousands!&#8221; corrected Elise. And Mona
said, &#8220;Looks to me like millions!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent that last big box, Patty?&#8221; asked
Nan; &#8220;the one that just came.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno, Nancy; probably the Czar of Russia
or the King of the Cannibal Islands. But I
mean to take time to eat my luncheon in peace,
even if the flowers aren&#8217;t all in place by the time
the company comes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay very long,&#8221; said Elise; &#8220;of
course, Mona and I have to go home and dress
and be back here at four o&#8217;clock, and it&#8217;s nearly
two, now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;the boys are coming,
and they&#8217;ll do the rest. We couldn&#8217;t hang
the flowers on the wall, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to have had a florist to attend to
it,&#8221; said Nan, thoughtfully; &#8220;I had no idea
there&#8217;d be so many.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221; returned Patty.
&#8220;Father&#8217;s coming home early, and Roger and
Ken will be over, and Mr. Hepworth will direct
proceedings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Even as she spoke the men&#8217;s voices were heard
in the hall, and Patty jumped up from the table
and ran to the drawing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see anything like it?&#8221; she exclaimed,
and her visitors agreed that they never
had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be awful to be so popular, Patty,&#8221;
said Roger. &#8220;If I ever come out, I shall ask
my friends to send fruit instead of flowers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty would have to start a canning factory,
if she had done that,&#8221; said Kenneth, laughing.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s open this big box, Patty. Who sent
it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an idea, but there must be a card
inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They opened the immense box, and found
it full to the brim with exquisite Killarney
roses.
</p>
<p>After some search, Roger discovered a small
envelope, with a card inside. The card read,
&#8220;Mr. William Farnsworth,&#8221; and written beneath
the engraved name was the message,
&#8220;With congratulations and best wishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From Big Bill!&#8221; exclaimed Mona. &#8220;For
goodness&#8217; sake, Patty, why didn&#8217;t he send you
more? But these didn&#8217;t come all the way from
Arizona, where he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, looking at the label on
the box; &#8220;he must have just sent an order to
a New York florist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To two or three florists, I should think,&#8221;
said Mr. Hepworth. &#8220;What can we do with
them all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the crowd of merry young people set to
work, and in an hour the floral chaos was reduced
to a wonderful vision of symmetry and
beauty. Under Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s directions,
the flowers were banked on the mantels and window-seats,
and hung in groups on the wall, and
clustered on the door-frames in a profusion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
which had behind it a methodical and symmetrical
intent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly beautiful!&#8221; declared Nan,
who, with her husband, was taking her first view
of the finished effect. &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect shame to
spoil this bower of beauty by cramming it with
a crowd of people, who will jostle your bouquets
all to bits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;You
see, we invited the people, as well as the flowers,
so we must take the consequences. But
they can&#8217;t reach those that are up high, and as
soon as the party is over, I&#8217;m going to put them
all in fresh water&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! the party?&#8221; and Kenneth looked astounded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean the flowers,&#8221; said Patty, not deigning
to laugh at his foolishness. &#8220;And then,
to-morrow morning, I&#8217;m going to send them all
to the hospital.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The people?&#8221; said Kenneth again.
&#8220;That&#8217;s thoughtful of you, Patty! I have no
doubt they&#8217;ll be in condition to go. I&#8217;m about
ready, myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you may go now,&#8221; and Patty smiled
at him. &#8220;Your work is done here, and I&#8217;m going
away to dress. Good-bye, Ken; this is the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
last time you&#8217;ll see me as a little girl. When
next we meet, I shall be a young lady, a fully-fledged
society lady, whose only thoughts will
be for dancing and gaiety of all sorts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Kenneth; &#8220;you can&#8217;t scare
me. You&#8217;ll be the same old Patty, foolish and
irresponsible,&mdash;but sunshiny and sweet as ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Ken,&#8221; said Patty, for there was
a note of earnestness in Kenneth&#8217;s voice that
the girl was quick to catch. They had been
friends since childhood, and while Patty did not
take her &#8220;coming out&#8221; very seriously, yet she
realised that it meant she was grown up and
a child no longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it all spoil you, Patty.&#8221; It was
Mr. Hepworth who said this, as he was about
to follow Kenneth out. &#8220;I have a right to lecture
you, you know, and I want to warn
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do it now, Mr. Hepworth,&#8221; said
Patty, laughing; &#8220;the occasion is solemn
enough, I&#8217;m sure, and if you lecture me, I shall
burst into large weeps of tears! Do let me
&#8216;come out&#8217; without being lectured, and you can
come round to-morrow and give me all the
warnings you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, little Patty,&#8221; and Hepworth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
looked at her kindly. &#8220;I ought not to spoil
one of the happiest days of your life with too
serious thought. Yours is a butterfly nature&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But butterfly natures are nice; aren&#8217;t they,
Mr. Hepworth?&#8221; and Patty looked up at him
with the roguishness that she could never quite
control.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and the man hesitated a moment,
as he looked into Patty&#8217;s blue eyes. Then, suddenly,
&#8220;Yes, indeed, <i>very</i> nice.&#8221; And, turning
abruptly, he left her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you girls, skip,&#8221; ordered Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t more than time to fly home and
get dressed, for I don&#8217;t want you to be late and
delay the ceremony.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious! it sounds like a wedding,&#8221; cried
Mona, laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;I may
have a wedding some day, but that&#8217;s in the far,
far future; why, I&#8217;m only just entering society,
and when I&#8217;m married, I suppose I shall leave
it. I expect to have heaps of fun between this
and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The programme for the occasion was an afternoon
reception, from four o&#8217;clock until seven.
This was really Patty&#8217;s début. A dinner at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
eight was to follow, to which were invited about
a dozen of her dearest friends, and after this
would be a dance, to which a goodly number
more were asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have time for an hour&#8217;s rest,
Patty,&#8221; said Nan, as she drew the girl away
from a last look at the beautiful flowers, and
took her up to her room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t, little steppy-mother. It
will be just about all Miss Patricia Fairfield
can do to get into her purple and fine linen by
four o&#8217;clock <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>p.m.</span>, and methinks you&#8217;d better begin
on your own glad toilette, or you&#8217;ll be late
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I <i>ever</i> late?&#8221; asked Nan, scornfully,
and as Patty responded, &#8220;never anything but,&#8221;
she ran away to her own room.
</p>
<p>However, four o&#8217;clock found all the members
of the reception party in their places.
</p>
<p>Patty looked adorable in soft white chiffon,
untrimmed, save for some fine lace round the
slightly low-cut neck. She wore a string of
small but perfect pearls which her father had
given her for the occasion, and she carried a
beautiful bouquet of orchids, which was Nan&#8217;s
gift.
</p>
<p>Patty had never looked prettier. Her rose-leaf
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
cheeks were slightly flushed with excitement,
and her big violet eyes were bright and
sparkling. Her golden hair, which was really
unusual in texture and quantity, was dressed
simply, yet in a manner very becoming to her
small, prettily poised head. On her brow and
temples it rippled in natural ringlets, which
gave her piquant face a charming, childish effect.
Patty was certainly a beauty, but she was
of such a sweet, unspoiled nature, and of such
simple, dainty manners, that everybody loved
her.
</p>
<p>Her father looked at her rather thoughtfully,
half unable to realise that his little Patty had
really grown up and was taking her place in
society. He had no fears for her, he knew her
sweet nature too well; but he was earnestly
hoping that she was starting out on a life of
happiness and well-being. Though healthy
and moderately strong, Patty was not of a robust
constitution, and there was danger that
too much gaiety might result in a nervous
breakdown. This, Mr. Fairfield determined
to guard against; and resolved that, while Patty
should be allowed generally to do as she chose,
he should keep a strict eye against her overdoing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>Nan had much the same thoughts as she
looked at the lovely débutante, so exquisite in
her fresh young beauty. Nan&#8217;s gown of heavy
white lace was very becoming, and though a
secondary figure, she ably shared the honours of
the afternoon with Patty.
</p>
<p>Mona and Elise assisted in the capacity of
&#8220;Floaters,&#8221; and in their pale pink frocks, they
were quite in harmony with the floral setting of
the picture.
</p>
<p>And then the guests began to arrive, and
Patty learned what it meant to stand and shake
hands, and receive the same compliments and
congratulations over and over again. It was
interesting at first, but she grew very tired as
the hours went by.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I say,&#8221; exclaimed a cheery voice, suddenly,
&#8220;it can&#8217;t be that you have to stand here
continuously from four to seven! Mrs. Fairfield,
mayn&#8217;t I take Patty to get a cup of tea or
an ice, and you stay here and &#8216;come out&#8217; until
she returns?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Philip Van Reypen who made this
request, and Nan consented readily. &#8220;Yes,
indeed, Philip,&#8221; she said, &#8220;do take her off to
rest a minute. I think most of the people have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
arrived; and, anyway, you must bring her back
shortly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; and young Van Reypen led Patty
through the crowd to the dining-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to find you a &#8216;quiet little corner,&#8217;&#8221;
he said, smiling; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see such a thing
anywhere about. So I&#8217;ll just place you on one
of these gimcrack gilt chairs, and I&#8217;ll ask you
to keep this one next, for me, until I make a
raid on the table. What will you have?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really want anything, Philip, but just
to sit here a moment and rest. I had no idea
coming out was so tiresome! I believe I&#8217;ve
said, &#8216;oh, thank you!&#8217; a billion times!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you said it to me,&#8221; and Philip laughed
at the recollection, &#8220;and I can tell you, Patty,
it had the real society ring! You said it like
a conventionalised parrot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care if I did! It was the
proper thing to say, and nobody could say it a
million times in succession, without sounding
parrotty! I know now how the President feels
when he has to shake hands with the whole
United States!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip left her, and returned in a moment, followed
by a waiter, who brought them hot
bouillon and tiny sandwiches.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My, but these are good!&#8221; exclaimed Patty,
as she nibbled and sipped. &#8220;Why, Philip, I
believe I was hungry and that&#8217;s what made me
tired! Oh, hello, Mona! Did you get leave
of absence, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the mad rush is pretty much over.
Only a few late stragglers now, and Elise is
floating them. Here&#8217;s Roger. He says you
wouldn&#8217;t speak to him this afternoon, except to
say, &#8216;oh, thank you!&#8217; three times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; returned Patty, laughing.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all I said to anybody. I felt like a
rubber stamp&mdash;repeating myself. Well, thank
goodness, I&#8217;m out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not a bit more grown up than
when you were in,&#8221; said Kenneth, joining the
group around Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, I&#8217;m never going to be grown up.
Now I&#8217;m rested, Philip; please take me back to
Nan. She said we must return soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty went back to the drawing-room, and
insisted that her stepmother should go for a
little refreshment. &#8220;I can hold the fort
alone now,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you&#8217;ve no idea how
capable I am, now that I&#8217;m really out. Run
along, Nan, and get some of those sandwiches;
they&#8217;re awfully good.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t romantic, Patty, to think about eating
when you&#8217;re celebrating an occasion like
this,&#8221; reproved Philip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not romantic,&#8221; declared Patty,
&#8220;and I never expect to be. Oh, how do you
do, Mr. Galbraith? It&#8217;s so late, I feared you
weren&#8217;t coming.&#8221; And Patty held out her hand
to Mona&#8217;s father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8216;y&#8217;do, Patty?&#8221; And Mr. Galbraith
shook hands heartily. &#8220;I suppose I ought to
say all sorts of pretty things to you, but you
know, I&#8217;m not much up in social chat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;and then I
won&#8217;t have to say, &#8216;oh, thank you!&#8217; to you.
Mona is looking beautiful this afternoon, isn&#8217;t
she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fine girl&mdash;a fine girl.&#8221; Mr. Galbraith&#8217;s
eyes rested on his daughter a little
thoughtfully. He was a Chicago man, who
had made his fortune suddenly, and was a little
bewildered at his own success. His one interest
in life, outside of business matters, was his
daughter Mona, for whom he desired every
possible good, and to whose wishes and whims
he always willingly consented.
</p>
<p>At her request, he had closed his Chicago
home and come to spend the winter in New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
York, that Mona might be near Patty, whom
she adored. The Galbraiths were living for
the winter at the Plaza Hotel, and Patty, who
had grown fond of Mona, was glad to have her
friend so near her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fine girl,&#8221; Mr. Galbraith repeated,
&#8220;and a good-looking girl.&#8221; He paused a moment,
and then added in a sudden burst of confidence,
&#8220;but, Patty, I wish she had a mother.
You know how I idolise her, but I can&#8217;t do for
her what a mother would do. I&#8217;ve urged her
to have a chaperon or a companion of some
sort, but she won&#8217;t do it. She says a father is
chaperon enough for her, and so we live alone
in that big hotel, and I&#8217;m afraid it isn&#8217;t right.
Right for her, I mean. I don&#8217;t care a snap
about conventions, but Mona is impulsive, even
headstrong, and I wish she had an older woman
to guide and advise her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she did, Mr. Galbraith,&#8221; said Patty,
earnestly, for the two were chatting by themselves,
and no one else was within hearing.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about it, and I&#8217;ve talked with my
stepmother about it. Perhaps I could persuade
Mona to do as you wish her to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you can, Patty; I do hope you can.
You know, Mona is dignified and all that, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
as proud as they make them. Nobody would
dare to speak to her if she didn&#8217;t want them to;
but, Patty, here&#8217;s the trouble. There&#8217;s a young
man at the hotel named Lansing. He&#8217;s not
especially attractive, and yet, somehow, he has
gained Mona&#8217;s favour. I have told my girl
that I do not like him, but she only laughs and
says carelessly that he&#8217;s all right. Now, I
mustn&#8217;t detain you longer, my child; there are
people waiting to speak to you. But, some
time, I want to have a little talk to you about
this, and perhaps you can help me in some way.
For I believe, Patty, that that Lansing man is
trying to win my girl for the sake of her money.
He has all the appearances of a fortune-hunter,
and I can&#8217;t let Mona throw herself away on
such.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think not!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, indignantly.
And then Mr. Galbraith moved away
to give his place to other guests who were arriving.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>AT THE DANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>At eight o&#8217;clock that same evening, Patty
came down to her own dinner party.
An hour&#8217;s rest had freshened her up
wonderfully, and she had changed her little
white frock for a dinner gown of pale green
chiffon, sparkling with silver embroidery. It
trailed behind her in a most grown-up fashion,
and she entered the drawing-room with an exaggerated
air of dignity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; cried Roger; &#8220;look at grown-up
Patty! Isn&#8217;t she the haughty lady? Patty,
if you put on such airs, you&#8217;ll be old before your
time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Airs, nothing!&#8221; retorted Patty, and with a
skipping little dance step, she crossed the room,
picked up a sofa pillow, and aimed it deftly at
Roger, who caught it on the wing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t have
any of these <i>grande dame</i> airs. Now, who is
the lucky man who is to take you out to dinner?
Me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, not you,&#8221; and Patty looked at him,
critically; &#8220;you won&#8217;t do, and neither will Kenneth,
nor Phil Van Reypen, nor Mr. Hepworth.&#8221;
She looked at them each in turn, and
smiled so merrily that they could take no offence.
&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall select the
best-looking and best-natured gentleman, and
walk out with him.&#8221; Whereupon she tucked
her arm through her father&#8217;s, and led the way
to the dining-room, followed by the rest of the
merry crowd.
</p>
<p>The dinner was a beautiful one, for Nan had
spared no pains or thought to make it worthy
of the occasion. At the girls&#8217; places were beautiful
souvenirs, in the shape of fans of carved
ivory with lace mounts, while the men received
attractive stick-pins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you feel like dancing after all this
gaiety, Patty?&#8221; asked Van Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, rather!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;Why,
I&#8217;d feel like dancing if I&#8217;d been through a&mdash;civil
war! I could scarcely keep still when the
orchestra was playing this afternoon, and I&#8217;m
crazy for to-night&#8217;s dance to begin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frivolous young person, very,&#8221; murmured
Philip. &#8220;Never saw such devotion to the vain
follies of life! However, since you&#8217;re determined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
to dance, will you honour me with the first
one to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t mind, if you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty,
dimpling at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And give me the second,&#8221; said Kenneth and
Roger simultaneously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do these sums in my head,&#8221; said
Patty; &#8220;I&#8217;ll get all mixed up. Let&#8217;s wait till
we get our dance orders, and fill them up, hit or
miss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You be the miss and I&#8217;ll try to make a hit,&#8221;
said Philip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What waggery!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, shaking
her head. &#8220;If you&#8217;re too clever, Philip, I
can&#8217;t dance with you. When I dance, I keep
my mind on my feet, not on my head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains your good dancing,&#8221; said Mr.
Hepworth, laughing. &#8220;Perhaps, if I could
keep my mind on my feet, I could dance better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re too highminded for such low
levels,&#8221; laughed Patty, while Mona, who was
rather practical, said, seriously, &#8220;Do you really
think about your feet all the time you&#8217;re dancing,
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Patty; &#8220;sometimes I have to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
think about my partner&#8217;s feet, to keep out of the
way of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they returned to the drawing-room, they
found it had been cleared for the dance, and
soon the evening guests began to arrive.
</p>
<p>Patty again stood by Nan to receive them, and
after greeting many people she knew, she was
surprised to find herself confronted by a
stranger. He was a thick-set, stockily-built
man, several years older than most of Patty&#8217;s
friends. He had black hair and eyes and a
short black moustache and a round, heavy type
of face. His black eyes were of the audacious
sort, and he flashed a glance of admiration at
Patty. Before she could speak, or even offer
her hand, Mona sprang forward, saying,
&#8220;Patty, this is my friend Mr. Lansing. I took
the liberty of inviting him to your dance. Mrs.
Fairfield, may I present Mr. Lansing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was angry. This, of course, must be
the man of whom Mr. Galbraith had spoken,
and, aside from the fact that he seemed undesirable,
Patty felt that Mona had no right to
invite him without asking permission from her
hostess.
</p>
<p>But Nan knew nothing of all this, and she cordially
greeted the stranger because he was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
friend of Mona&#8217;s. Patty recovered her equilibrium
sufficiently to say, &#8220;How do you do, Mr.
Lansing?&#8221; in a non-committal sort of way, but
she couldn&#8217;t refrain from giving Mona a side
glance of reproof, to which, however, that
young woman paid no attention.
</p>
<p>In another moment Mona had drifted away,
and had taken Mr. Lansing with her. Patty
turned to speak to Nan about him, but just then
some more guests arrived; and then the dancing
began, and Patty had no further opportunity.
</p>
<p>As Patty had promised, she gave the first
dance to Philip Van Reypen; and after that she
was fairly besieged by would-be partners. The
fact that she was hostess at her own coming-out
ball, the fact that she danced beautifully, and
the fact that she was so pretty and charming,
all combined to make her, as was not unusual,
the most popular girl present.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything left for me?&#8221; asked Roger, gaily,
as he threaded the crowds at Patty&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved one for you,&#8221; said Patty, smiling at
him; &#8220;for I hoped you&#8217;d ask me, sooner or
later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roger gratefully accepted the dance Patty had
saved for him, and soon after he came to claim
her for it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Patty,&#8221; he began when they were
whirling about the floor, &#8220;who is that stuff
Mona has trailing after her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderate your language, Roger,&#8221; said
Patty, smiling up at him, and noticing that his
expression was very wrathy indeed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t deserve moderate language!
He&#8217;s a bounder, if I ever saw one! What&#8217;s he
doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to be dancing,&#8221; said Patty, demurely,
&#8220;and he doesn&#8217;t dance half badly,
either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop your fooling, Patty; I&#8217;m not in
the mood for it. Tell me who he is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had never known Roger to be so out of
temper, and she resented his tone, which was
almost rude. Now, for all her sweetness,
Patty had a touch of perversity in her nature,
and Roger had roused it. So she said: &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know why you speak like that, Roger.
He&#8217;s a friend of Mona&#8217;s, and lives at the Hotel
Plaza, where she lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that two people live in the same
big hotel doesn&#8217;t give them the right to be
friends,&#8221; growled Roger. &#8220;Who introduced
them, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Patty, her patience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
exhausted; &#8220;but Mr. Galbraith knows
him, so it must be all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was not quite ingenuous in this speech,
for she knew perfectly well, from what Mr.
Galbraith had said to her, that it was not all
right. But she was irritated by Roger&#8217;s demeanour,
and perversely disagreed with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s all right; I don&#8217;t
like his looks a bit, and, Patty, you know as
well as I do, that the Galbraiths are not quite
competent always to select the people best
worth knowing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a fuss you are, Roger; and it&#8217;s
hardly fair when you don&#8217;t know anything at
all about Mr. Lansing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and then Patty hesitated. She did
know something,&mdash;she knew what Mr. Galbraith
had told her. But she was not of a mind
to tell this to Roger. &#8220;I only met him as I
was introduced,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and Mona has
never so much as even mentioned him to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she ask you if she might bring him
to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I suppose, as an intimate friend, she
didn&#8217;t think that necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> necessary, Patty, and you know it, if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Mona doesn&#8217;t. Now, look here; you and I
are Mona&#8217;s friends; and if there are any social
matters that she isn&#8217;t quite familiar with, it&#8217;s
up to us to help her out a little. And I, for
one, don&#8217;t believe that man is the right sort
for her to be acquainted with; and I&#8217;m going
to find out about him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m willing you should,
Roger; but you needn&#8217;t make such a bluster
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not making a bluster, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then they both realised that they were
bickering like two children, and they laughed
simultaneously as they swept on round the
dancing-room. The music stopped just then,
and as they were near a window-seat, Patty sat
down for a moment. &#8220;You go on, Roger,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and hunt up your next partner, or
fight a duel with Mr. Lansing, or do whatever
amuses you. My partner will come to hunt
me up, I&#8217;m sure, and I&#8217;ll just wait here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is your next partner, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t looked at my card; but, never mind,
he&#8217;ll come. You run along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Roger&#8217;s next partner was Mona, and as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
he was anxious to talk to her about her new
friend, Roger obeyed Patty&#8217;s bidding and
strolled away.
</p>
<p>Patty sat alone for a moment, knowing full
well who was her next partner, and then Mr.
Lansing appeared and made a low bow before
her.
</p>
<p>Now, Patty had not chosen to express to
Roger her real opinion of this new man, but
in reality she did not approve of him. Though
fairly good-looking and correctly dressed, there
was about him a certain something&mdash;or perhaps,
rather, he lacked a certain something that invariably
stamps the well-bred man. He stared
at Patty a trifle too freely; he sat down beside
her with a little too much informality; and he
began conversation a little too familiarly. All
of these things Patty saw and resented, but as
hostess she could not, of course, be openly rude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice, jolly rooms you&#8217;ve got here for a
party,&#8221; Mr. Lansing remarked, rolling his eyes
about appreciatively, &#8220;and a jolly lot of people,
too. Some class to &#8217;em!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at him coldly. She was not accustomed
to this style of expression. Her
friends perhaps occasionally used a slang word
or term, but it was done in a spirit of gaiety or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
as a jest, whereas this man used his expressions
as formal conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have many kind and delightful
friends,&#8221; said Patty, a little stiffly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure have! Rich, too, most of &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty made no response to this, and Mr. Lansing
turned suddenly to look at her. &#8220;I say,
Miss Fairfield, do you know what I think? I
think you are prejudiced against me, and I
think somebody put you up to it, and I think I
know who. Now, look here, won&#8217;t you give me
a fair show? Do you think it&#8217;s just to judge a
man by what other people say about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I&#8217;ve heard anything
about you, Mr. Lansing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you give me the icy glare before I&#8217;ve
said half a dozen words to you! So, take it
from me, somebody&#8217;s been putting you wise to
my defects.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wagged his head so sagaciously at this
speech, that Patty was forced to smile. On a
sudden impulse, she decided to speak frankly.
&#8220;Suppose I tell you the truth, Mr. Lansing,
that I&#8217;m not accustomed to being addressed in
such&mdash;well, in such slangy terms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it? Pooh, I&#8217;ll bet those chums
of yours talk slang to you once in a while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What my chums may do is no criterion for
an absolute stranger,&#8221;&mdash;and now Patty spoke
very haughtily indeed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Miss Fairfield; you&#8217;re dead right,&mdash;and
I apologise. But, truly, it&#8217;s a habit with
me. I&#8217;m from Chicago, and I believe people
use more slang out there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The best Chicago people don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty,
seriously.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lansing smiled at her, a trifle whimsically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t class up with the best people,&#8221;
he confessed; &#8220;but if it will please you
better, I&#8217;ll cut out the slang. Shall we have a
turn at this two-step?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty rose without a word, and in a moment
they were circling the floor. Mr. Lansing was
a good dancer, and especially skilful in guiding
his partner. Patty, herself such an expert
dancer, was peculiarly sensitive to the good
points of a partner, and she enjoyed the dance
with Mr. Lansing, even though she felt she did
not like the man. And yet he had a certain
fascination in his manner, and when the dance
was over, Patty looked at him with kinder eyes
than she had when they began. But all that he
had won of her favour he lost by his final
speech, for as the dance ended, he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
brusquely: &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll tumble you into a seat,
and chase my next victim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty stood looking after him, almost moved
to laughter at what he had said, and yet indignant
that a man, and a comparative stranger,
should address her thus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Lady Fair?&#8221; and Philip
Van Reypen came up to her. &#8220;Methinks thou
hast a ruffled brow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s my frock that&#8217;s ruffled,&#8221; said Patty,
demurely. &#8220;You men know so little of millinery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough, and if you will smile
again, I&#8217;ll drop the subject of ruffles. And now
for my errand; will you go out to supper with
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, is it supper time? I thought the
evening had scarcely begun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas! look at the programme,&#8221; and Van
Reypen showed her that it was, indeed, time for
intermission.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Intermission is French for supper,&#8221; he said,
gravely, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like to know if you&#8217;d rather
sit on the stairs in good old orthodox party
fashion, or if you&#8217;d rather go to the dining-room
in state?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are on the stairs?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be, if you are. You don&#8217;t want to
know more than that, do you?&#8221; The young
man&#8217;s gaze was so reproachful that Patty giggled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a great factor in my happiness, Mr.
Van Reypen,&#8221; she said, saucily; &#8220;but you are
not all the world to me! So, if I flock on
the stairs with you, I must know what other
doves will be perching there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, doves!&#8221; in a tone of great relief. &#8220;I
thought you wanted to know what men you
would find there,&mdash;you inveterate coquette, you!
Well, Elise is there waiting for you, and Miss
Farley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mona Galbraith?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I didn&#8217;t see Miss Galbraith.
But if you will go with me, I will accumulate
for you any young ladies you desire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And any men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men I shall have to fight off, not invite!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laughing at each other&#8217;s chaff, they sauntered
across to the hall and found the stairs already
pretty well occupied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it,&#8221; Mr. Hepworth was saying,
&#8220;that you young people prefer the stairs to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
nice, comfortable seats at little tables in the
dining-room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Habit,&#8221; said Patty, laughing, as she made
her way up a few steps; &#8220;I&#8217;ve always eaten my
party suppers on the stairs, and I dare say I
always shall. When I build a house I shall
have a great, broad staircase, like they have in
palaces, and then everybody can eat on the
stairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give a party,&#8221; announced Van
Reypen, &#8220;and it&#8217;s going to be in the new
Pennsylvania Station. There are enormous
staircases there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll come to it,&#8221; said Patty, and
then Mona and Mr. Lansing came strolling
along the hall, and demanded room on the
stairs also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seats all taken,&#8221; declared Roger, who had
had a real tiff with Mona on the subject of her
new friend. The others, too, did not seem to
welcome Mr. Lansing, and though one or two
moved slightly, they did not make room for
the newcomers.
</p>
<p>Patty was uncertain what she ought to do.
She remembered what Mr. Galbraith had said,
and she felt that to send Mona and Mr. Lansing
away would be to throw them more exclusively
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
in each other&#8217;s society; and she thought
that Mr. Galbraith meant for her to keep Mona
under her own eye as much as possible. But
to call the pair upon the stairs and make room
for them would annoy, she felt sure, the rest
of the group.
</p>
<p>She looked at Roger and at Philip Van Reypen,
and both of them gave her an eloquent
glance of appeal not to add to their party.
Then she chanced to glance at Mr. Hepworth
and found him smiling at her. She thought
she knew what he meant, and immediately she
said, &#8220;Come up here by me, Mona; and you
come too, Mr. Lansing. We can make room
easily if we move about a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was considerable moving about, and
finally Patty found herself at the top of the
group with Mona and Mr. Lansing. Christine
and Mr. Hepworth were directly below
them, and then Elise and Kenneth.
</p>
<p>Mr. Van Reypen and Roger Farrington declared
their intention of making a raid on the
dining-room and kidnapping waiters with trays
of supplies. On their return the supper plates
were passed up to those on the stairs, and Van
Reypen and Roger calmly walked away.
</p>
<p>Patty knew perfectly well what they meant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
They intended her to understand that if she and
Mona persisted in cultivating the acquaintance
of the man they considered objectionable, they
did not care to be of the party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is perfectly ridiculous!&#8221; said Patty
to herself, as she realised the state of things.
&#8220;Those boys needn&#8217;t think they can dictate to
me at my own party!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon, perverse Patty began to make
herself extremely and especially agreeable to
Mr. Lansing, and Mona was greatly delighted
at the turn things had taken.
</p>
<p>Christine and Mr. Hepworth joined in the
conversation, and perhaps because of what
Patty had said earlier in the evening, Mr. Lansing
avoided to a great extent the use of slang
expressions, and made himself really interesting
and entertaining.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a fascinating man he is,&#8221; said Christine
later, to Patty, when Mona and her new
friend had walked away to the &#8220;extra&#8221; supper
dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; said Patty, looking at
Christine in astonishment. &#8220;He was rather
nicer than I thought him at first, but, Christine,
I never dreamed <i>you</i> would approve of him!
But you never can tell when a quiet little mouse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
like you is going to break loose. Why did you
like him, Christine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly; only he seemed so
breezy and unusual.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s that,&#8221; and Patty wagged her head,
knowingly; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t like him very much,
Christine, and you mustn&#8217;t, either. Now run
away and play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s last direction was because she saw a
young man coming to ask Christine for this
dance; while two others were rapidly coming
toward herself.
</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was danced gaily
away, but neither Roger nor Philip Van Reypen
came near Patty. To be sure, she had plenty
of partners, but she felt a little offended at her
two friends&#8217; attitude, for she knew she hadn&#8217;t
really deserved it.
</p>
<p>But when the dance was over, Patty&#8217;s good-nights
to Roger and Philip were quite as gentle
and cordial as those she said to any one else.
She smiled her best smiles at them, and though
not as responsive as usual, they made polite
adieux and departed with no further reference
to the troublesome matter.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>HAPPY SATURDAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>As was not to be wondered at, Patty slept
late the next morning. And when she
awakened, she lay, cozily tucked in her
coverlets, thinking over the occurrences of the
night before.
</p>
<p>Presently Jane came in with a dainty tray of
chocolate and rolls, and then, with some big,
fluffy pillows behind her, Patty sat up in bed,
and thoughtfully nibbled away at a crust.
</p>
<p>Then Nan came in, in her pretty morning
gown, and, drawing up a little rocker, sat down
by Patty&#8217;s bedside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in mood for a gossip, Patty?&#8221; she
asked, and Patty replied, &#8220;Yes, indeedy! I
want to talk over the whole thing. In the first
place, Nan, it was a howling, screaming success,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course; how could it be otherwise?
with the nicest people and the nicest flowers
and the nicest girl in New York City!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the whole United States, you mean,&#8221; said
Patty, complacently, as she took a spoonful of
chocolate. &#8220;Yes, the party in all its parts was
all right. There wasn&#8217;t a flaw. But, oh, Nan,
I got into a scrap with the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What boys? and what <i>is</i> a scrap? Patty,
now that you&#8217;re out, you mustn&#8217;t use those slang
words you&#8217;re so fond of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan,&#8221; and Patty shook her spoon solemnly
at her stepmother, &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to realise that
there is slang and slang. Now, the few little
innocent bits I use, don&#8217;t count at all, because
I just say them for fun and to help make
my meaning clear. But that man last night,&mdash;that
Lansing man,&mdash;why, Nan, his slang is altogether
a different matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Patty, he, himself, seems to be an altogether
different matter from the people we
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, doesn&#8217;t he? And yet, Nan, he isn&#8217;t
so bad. Well, anyway, let me tell you what
Mr. Galbraith says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; declared Nan, after Patty
had finished her story. &#8220;That man <i>is</i> a fortune-hunter,
and he means to try to marry
Mona for the sake of her father&#8217;s money!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, laughing; &#8220;isn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
it grand to be grown up! I see I&#8217;m mixed up
in a matrimonial tangle already!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort, you foolish child!
There won&#8217;t be any matrimonial tangle. Mr.
Galbraith is quite right; this man must be discouraged,
and Mona must be made to see him
in his true light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Nan, he isn&#8217;t so awful. You know,
sometimes he was quite fascinating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you think that, because he has big dark
eyes and rolled them at you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! it sounds like a game of bowls.
No, I don&#8217;t mean that; but&mdash;well, I&#8217;ll tell you
what I do mean. He said we weren&#8217;t fair to
him, to judge him adversely, not knowing anything
about him. And I think so, too, Nan;
it doesn&#8217;t seem fair or right to say a man is a
bounder,&mdash;that&#8217;s what Roger called him,&mdash;when
we don&#8217;t know anything about him,
really.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re a goose! Don&#8217;t you suppose
we&#8217;ll find out about him? Of course, <i>we</i> can&#8217;t,
but your father and Mr. Galbraith,&mdash;yes, and
Roger Farrington, will soon find out his standing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Patty, with a relieved sigh,
&#8220;then I needn&#8217;t bother about <i>him</i> any more.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
But, Nan, I have troubles of my own. Philip
and Roger are both mad at me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness! Patty, how awful! Do you suppose
they&#8217;ll stay mad all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t just a momentary tiff; they are
up and down angry! Why, neither of them
danced with me or even spoke to me after supper
last night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was probably your own fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My own fault, indeed! It was all because of
that horrid Lansing man. Well, if they want
to stay mad, they may! <i>I</i> shan&#8217;t make any
advances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, my child. Into each life some
little squabbles must fall,&mdash;and though you&#8217;re
fairly good-natured, as a rule, you can&#8217;t expect
it always to be smooth sailing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seeing she could get no sympathy from her
stepmother, Patty dropped the subject of her
quarrels, and remarked, with a yawn, &#8220;Well,
I suppose I may as well get up, and begin on
those flower notes. What shall I say, Nan,
something like this? &#8216;Miss Patricia Fairfield
thanks you for your kind donation of expensive
blossoms, but as it&#8217;s such a bother to write
the notes of acknowledgment, she really wishes
you hadn&#8217;t sent them.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What base ingratitude! Patty, I&#8217;m ashamed
of you! or I would be, if I thought you meant
a word of it, but I know you don&#8217;t. What are
you doing this afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot to tell you. We&#8217;re going to
have a club, just a little club,&mdash;only four of us
girls. And, Nan, you know there are so many
clubs that make an awful fuss and yet don&#8217;t
really <i>do</i> anything. Well, this is going to be
a <i>Doing</i> Club. We&#8217;re going to be real
<i>doers</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds lovely, Patty. What are you going
to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know yet, that&#8217;s what the meeting&#8217;s
for this afternoon. But we&#8217;re going to
do good, you know&mdash;some kind of good. You
know, Nan, I always said I didn&#8217;t want to be
just a social butterfly and nothing else. I want
to accomplish something that will give some
joy or comfort to somebody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s blue eyes looked very earnest and
sincere as she said this, and Nan kissed her, saying,
&#8220;I know you do, Patty, dearest, and I
know you&#8217;ll succeed in your doing. If I can
help you in any way, be sure to ask me; and
now I&#8217;ll run away and let you dress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty made a leisurely toilette; and then, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
a trailing blue silk négligée, she went into her
boudoir and began to write her notes.
</p>
<p>It was not a difficult task, and she did not
really mind it, though it was a long list. But
Patty had a knack at writing graceful little
notes, and although she jested about it, she was
really grateful to the kind friends who had sent
the flowers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know <i>why</i> I have so many friends,&#8221;
she said to herself, as she scanned the rows of
names. &#8220;To be sure, a great many are really
friends of father&#8217;s and Nan&#8217;s, but there&#8217;s a lot
of our crowd, too, and lots of out of town
people. Perhaps it would be a good idea to
do the farthest away first, and so work back
to New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty picked up Mr. Farnsworth&#8217;s card, and
read again the message on it. &#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; she
said to herself, &#8220;it sounds to me a trifle formal
and conventional&mdash;considering all things.
Now, Little Billee is a Western man,&mdash;but how
different he is from that Lansing person! I
wonder what makes the difference. Little
Billee isn&#8217;t formal or conventional a bit, and
yet his manners are as far removed from Horace
Lansing&#8217;s as white is from black. Oh,
well, I know the reason well enough. It&#8217;s because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Little Billee is a thorough gentleman at
heart; and the other one is,&mdash;well, I guess he&#8217;s
what Roger called him. Now, what shall I say
to Mr. William Farnsworth by way of thanks
for his truly beautiful pink roses? I&#8217;d like to
write a nice, every-day letter, and tell him all
about the party and everything; but, as he
just sent his visiting card, with a mere line
on it, I suppose I must reply very formally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty began her formal note, but tore up half
a dozen beginnings before she completed one to
her satisfaction. This one read, &#8220;Miss Patricia
Fairfield thanks Mr. William Farnsworth
sincerely for his exquisite gift of roses, and for
his kind congratulations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty gave a little sigh as she sealed this missive
and addressed it to her friend in Arizona.
</p>
<p>With the exception of the roses, Patty had
never heard a word from Big Bill since they
were at Spring Beach together. She had told
her father and Nan of what Mr. Farnsworth
had said to her down there, and as they had
agreed that Patty was altogether too young
even to think of such a thing as being engaged
to anybody, it was wiser to hold no correspondence
with him at all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Apparently, this in no way disappointed the
young man, for he had made no effort on his
part to recall himself to Patty&#8217;s remembrance,
until the occasion of sending the flowers.
</p>
<p>Patty had liked Bill extremely, but as Arizona
was far away, and she had no reason to think
she would ever see him again, she gave him few
thoughts. However, the thoughts, when she
did allow them to come, were pleasant ones.
Although she had sealed the note she intended
to send, she began another one, and the opening
words were &#8220;Little Billee.&#8221; This note she
wrote in the first person, and thanked him simply
and naturally for the flowers. Then, for a
signature, she made a carefully and daintily
drawn pen-and-ink sketch of an apple blossom.
She was clever at flower-sketching, and she sat a
moment admiring her own handiwork. Then
a flush spread over her pretty face, and she
spoke sternly to herself, as was her habit when
she disapproved of her own actions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Fairfield,&#8221; she said, reprovingly, &#8220;you
ought to be ashamed to think of sending a personal,
lettery sort of a note like that, to a man
who sent you the formalest kind of a message!
He only sent the flowers, because convention
demanded it! He never gave you one single
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
thought after that last time he saw you,&mdash;and
that&#8217;s all there is about <i>that</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then, to her great surprise, luncheon was
announced, and she found that her whole morning
was gone and only one name on her list
crossed off!
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The club that met that afternoon in Mona&#8217;s
pretty sitting-room in the Plaza Hotel, consisted
of only four girls&mdash;Patty, Mona, Elise,
and Clementine Morse.
</p>
<p>It was thought wiser to start with a few earnest
members and then enlarge the number later
if it seemed advisable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a beautiful room!&#8221; said Clementine,
as she tossed off her furs. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you like it,
Mona, to live in a big hotel like this, and yet
have your own rooms, like a home all to yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like it in some ways; but I&#8217;m alone
a great deal. However, I would be that, if
father and I lived in a house or an apartment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to have a companion of some
sort, Mona,&#8221; said Patty, who thought this a
good opportunity to urge Mr. Galbraith&#8217;s
wishes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; and Mona tossed her head,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
disdainfully; &#8220;I know what companions are!
Snoopy old maids who won&#8217;t let you do anything,
or careless, easy-going old ladies who pay
no attention to you. If I could have a companion
of my own age and tastes, I&#8217;d like that,&mdash;but
I suppose that wouldn&#8217;t do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Elise, laughing; &#8220;that would
only mean your father would have two troublesome
girls to look after instead of one. And
I daresay, Mona, you are quite as much as he
can handle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am. But he&#8217;s so good to me
I&#8217;m afraid he spoils me. But come on, girls,
let&#8217;s organise our club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s have too much organisation,&#8221;
said Clementine. &#8220;Do you know, I think lots
of clubs, especially charity clubs, have so much
organisation that they haven&#8217;t anything else.
One club I joined fell to pieces before it was
fairly started, because the two vice-presidents
squabbled so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I hate,&#8221; declared Patty,
&#8220;it&#8217;s a squabble. Whatever else we girls do,
let&#8217;s try not to have any friction. Now, I
know perfectly well that none of us four is <i>very</i>
meek or mild.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; declared Elise, assuming an angelic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
expression, which made them all laugh, for
Elise was really the one most likely to take
offence at trifles, or to flare up impulsively if
any one disagreed with her.
</p>
<p>Patty knew this only too well, and was trying
to forestall it by a preliminary treaty of
peace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, let&#8217;s be an organisation that
doesn&#8217;t organise,&#8221; said Mona, &#8220;but let&#8217;s be it
<i>now</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;that our end and aim
ought to be to do good to somebody who
doesn&#8217;t expect it. Now, that isn&#8217;t quite what I
mean,&mdash;I mean to people who wouldn&#8217;t accept
it if it seemed like charity, but to whom we
could give a pleasure that they would really
like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, my child,&#8221; said Clementine, &#8220;I think
your ideas are all right, but I must say you
don&#8217;t express them very clearly. Let&#8217;s get
down to something definite. Do you mean to
give material things,&mdash;like presents or money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just exactly what I <i>don&#8217;t</i> mean, Clem!
Don&#8217;t you remember that little club we used to
have at school,&mdash;the Merry Grigs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do! All we had to do was to be
merry and gay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I mean,&mdash;in a way,&mdash;if
you know what I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty,&#8221; cried Mona, &#8220;I never knew you
to be so hopelessly vague. Now, for instance,
how would it be if we gave a lovely motor ride
to some poor shop girl, or somebody that never
gets into a motor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried Clementine, approvingly;
&#8220;I was thinking of sending flowers to hospitals,
but that&#8217;s so general. Now, your suggestion,
Mona, is definite, and just the right sort of
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t we going to have a president and
treasurer, and things like that?&#8221; asked Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;my mind is clearing now,
and I begin to see our club. Instead of a president,
we&#8217;ll all four be presidents, and instead of
a treasurer, we&#8217;ll all four be treasurers. We&#8217;ll
give money when it&#8217;s necessary, or we&#8217;ll use our
motor cars, or buy flowers, or whatever we like;
but we won&#8217;t have dues and officers and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the shop girls are always busy; how
can we take them motoring?&#8221; asked Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only a suggestion,&#8221; said Mona;
&#8220;it needn&#8217;t be exactly a shop girl; but anybody
we know of, who would enjoy a little unexpected
pleasure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The principle is exactly right,&#8221; said Clementine;
&#8220;now, let&#8217;s get it down to practicability.
As Mona says, we needn&#8217;t necessarily choose a
shop girl,&mdash;but suppose we do, many of them
are free Saturday afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in the summer time,&#8221; objected Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, perhaps, in the big shops; but there are
lots of them, in offices,&mdash;or even school teachers,&mdash;who
would be free Saturday afternoons.
Well, anyway, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking of, and
you can all say what you think of it. Suppose
we try, every week, to give a happy Saturday
afternoon to somebody who wouldn&#8217;t have it
otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Happy Saturday Afternoon Club!&#8221;
cried Patty; &#8220;that&#8217;s a lovely name! let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;that would mean giving
up our Saturday afternoons. Do we want to
do that? What about matinées?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we ought to be willing to sacrifice
something,&#8221; said Patty, thoughtfully; &#8220;but I
do love Saturday matinées.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if there&#8217;s anything especial, we needn&#8217;t
consider ourselves bound to give up the afternoon,&#8221;
said Clementine. &#8220;For that matter,
we could send a couple of girls for a motor ride
without going ourselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s more like charity,&#8221; objected
Patty: &#8220;I meant to go with them, and be real
nice and pleasant with them, and make a bright
spot in their lives that they would always remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d always remember you, Patty, if you
were the bright spot,&#8221; declared Mona, who
idolised her friend. &#8220;But I must confess I do
like to be definite about this thing. Now,
how&#8217;s this for a plan? To-day&#8217;s Thursday.
Suppose we begin on Saturday and make a start
at something. Suppose we each of us pick out
a girl,&mdash;or a boy, for that matter,&mdash;or a child
or anybody, and think what we can do to make
them happy on Saturday afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re getting somewhere,&#8221; said Elise,
approvingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve picked mine already.
She&#8217;s a girl who comes to our house quite often
to sew for the children. She&#8217;s a sweet little
thing, but she looks as if she never had a real
good time in all her life. Now, can the rest of
you think of anybody like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have one,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;Your suggestion
made me think of her. She&#8217;s my manicure
girl. She comes here, and sometimes she&#8217;s
so tired she&#8217;s ready to drop! She works awfully
hard, and never takes a day off, because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
she has to support two little sisters. But I&#8217;ll
make her take a holiday Saturday afternoon,
somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a girl I&#8217;d like to have,&#8221; said Clementine,
thoughtfully; &#8220;she&#8217;s at the ribbon
counter in Walker&#8217;s. She always waits on me
there; and she has such a wistful air, I&#8217;d like to
do her a kindness. I don&#8217;t suppose she could
get off,&mdash;but I could go and ask the head of the
department, and perhaps he&#8217;d let her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anybody,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;except
one person, that I would simply <i>love</i> to
have. And that&#8217;s a very tired and cross-looking
lady who gives out embroidery patterns in
a dreadful place, way down town. I believe it
would sweeten her up for a year to have a little
spree with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;Now we have selected
our guests, what shall we do with them?
Say, a motor ride and a cup of tea afterward in
some pretty tea room?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Elise, &#8220;that we&#8217;d better give
them luncheon first. They can&#8217;t enjoy a motor
ride if they&#8217;re hungry, and they probably will
be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Luncheon where?&#8221; said Patty, looking puzzled;
&#8220;at one of our houses?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could have them here, easily enough,&#8221; said
Mona. &#8220;Our dining-room here, would really
be better than any of the homes of you girls.
Because you all have people, and I haven&#8217;t.
Father would just as lieve lunch downstairs, in
the main dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lovely of you, Mona,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;I was going to suggest some small, quiet restaurant,
but a luncheon here in your pretty dining-room
would indeed be a bright spot for
them to remember. But suppose they won&#8217;t
come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must ask someone instead,&#8221; said
Clementine; &#8220;let&#8217;s promise each to bring someone
with us on Saturday, and if the first one
we ask declines, keep on asking till we get somebody.
Of course, Mona, we&#8217;ll share the expense
of the luncheon equally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; returned Mona; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to
give that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, firmly; &#8220;we&#8217;ll each pay a
quarter of whatever the luncheon costs. And
let&#8217;s have it good and substantial, and yet have
some pretty, fancy things too. For, you know,
this isn&#8217;t a charity or a soup kitchen,&mdash;it&#8217;s to
give those girls a bright and beautiful scene to
look back on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be lovely!&#8221; cried Mona. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have pretty place cards, and favours, and everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we mustn&#8217;t overdo it,&#8221; said Clementine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, to the unaccustomed, an elaborate
table may prove embarrassing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be all right,&#8221; said Patty, smiling.
&#8220;Mona can fix her table, and I&#8217;ll come over before
the luncheon, and if she has too many or
too grand flumadiddles, I&#8217;ll take some of them
off. I don&#8217;t want our guests struck dumb by
too much grandeur, but I do want things pretty
and nice. Suppose we each bring a favor for
our own guest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something useful?&#8221; said Elise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; <i>not</i> a suit of flannel underwear or a
pair of shoes! But a pretty necktie or handkerchief,
if you like, or even a little gold pin,
or a silver one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a picture or cast,&#8221; said Clementine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and Patty nodded approval; &#8220;but it
ought to be a little thing that would look like
a luncheon souvenir and not like a Christmas
present. I think they ought to be all
alike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Mona, &#8220;and I think a little
pin in a jeweler&#8217;s box will be the prettiest; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
then a lovely bunch of flowers at each plate, and
an awfully pretty place-card.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be beautiful!&#8221; cried Patty, jumping
up and dancing about the room; &#8220;but I
must flit, girls,&mdash;I have an engagement at five.
Wait, what about motors? I&#8217;m sure we can
use our big car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And ours,&#8221; said all the rest together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll need two,&#8221; said Clementine,
&#8220;and two of us girls and two guests can go in
each. We&#8217;ll see which cars can be used most
conveniently; perhaps our fathers may have
something to say on that subject. But we can
arrange all such things by telephone to-morrow.
The main thing is to get our guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;if we have
to go out into the highways and hedges after
them.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>AN INVITATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning Patty started off in her
own little electric runabout with Miller,
the chauffeur.
</p>
<p>She let him drive, and gave the address, as she
stepped in, &#8220;The Monongahela Art Embroidery
Company,&#8221; adding a number in lower
Broadway.
</p>
<p>The correct Miller could not suppress a slight
smile as he said, &#8220;Where I took you once before,
Miss Patty?&#8221; And Patty smiled, as she
said, &#8220;Yes, Miller.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was with a different feeling that she
entered the big building this time, and she went
straight to department B. On her way she met
the red-headed boy who had so amused her
when she was there a year ago.
</p>
<p>He greeted her with the same lack of formality
that had previously characterised him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is youse up against it again?&#8221; he inquired,
grinning broadly. &#8220;I t&#8217;ought youse didn&#8217;t get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
no cinch, and had to can de whole projick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not on the same &#8216;projick&#8217; now,&#8221; said
Patty, smiling at him. &#8220;Is department B in
the same place?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it is,&#8221; and for some reason the boy
added, &#8220;miss,&#8221; after a momentary pause,
which made Patty realise his different attitude
toward her, now that she wore a more elaborate
costume, than when he had seen her in a purposely
plain little suit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And is the same lady still in charge of
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep; dey ain&#8217;t nuttin&#8217; lessen dynnimite goin&#8217;
to boost Mis&#8217; Greene outen o&#8217; here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Mrs. Greene is the lady I want to see,&#8221;
and Patty threaded her way through the narrow
passages between the piled up boxes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No pass needed; she&#8217;s a free show,&#8221; the boy
called after her, and in a moment Patty found
herself again in the presence of the sharp-faced,
tired-looking woman whom she had once interviewed
regarding her embroidery work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Mrs. Greene, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Patty,
pleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; snapped the woman. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t want work again, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty, smiling, &#8220;I come this time
on quite a different errand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t want to see <i>me</i>. I&#8217;m here
only to give out work. Did Mr. Myers send
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I came of my own accord. Now, Mrs.
Greene, forget the work for a moment, and let
me tell you what I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s subscribin&#8217; to any fund, or belongin&#8217;
to any working woman&#8217;s club run by you swell
ladies, you can count me out. I ain&#8217;t got time
for foolishness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anything like that,&#8221; and Patty
laughed so merrily that Mrs. Greene&#8217;s hard face
softened in spite of herself. &#8220;Well, what is
it?&#8221; she asked, in a less belligerent tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only this,&#8221; and though Patty&#8217;s errand
had seemed to her simple enough before she
came in, she now began to wonder how Mrs.
Greene would take it. &#8220;Some friends of mine
and I are asking three or four people to lunch
with us and take a little motor ride on Saturday,
and I want you to come as my guest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; and Mrs. Greene&#8217;s face was blank
with amazement, but her manner betokened an
impending burst of wrath.
</p>
<p>Patty realised that the woman&#8217;s pride was up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
in arms at the idea of patronage, and she was
at her wit&#8217;s end how to make the real spirit of
her invitation understood.
</p>
<p>As it chanced, she unwittingly took the right
tack. So earnest was she that her lips quivered
a little, and her eyes showed a pleading, pathetic
expression, as she said, &#8220;<i>Please</i> don&#8217;t misunderstand
me, Mrs. Greene. If you would enjoy it,
I want you to come to our party on Saturday as
our welcome guest. If you wouldn&#8217;t enjoy it,&mdash;just
say so,&mdash;but&mdash;but <i>don&#8217;t</i> scold me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene looked puzzled, and then the
hard, stern mouth broke into an actual smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I declare,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I do believe
you&#8217;ve got a real heart!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I do believe that <i>you</i> have!&#8221; exclaimed
Patty. &#8220;And, now that we know the truth
about each other, you&#8217;ll come, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; and the speaker seemed
still uncertain, though wavering.
</p>
<p>So Patty told her, honestly and straightforwardly,
the circumstances of the party, and
wound up by saying, &#8220;I truly want you, Mrs.
Greene, for the simple reason that I want you to
enjoy the afternoon,&mdash;and for no other reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll come, and be awful glad of the
chance! Why, I&#8217;ve never had a ride in a motor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
car in my life, and I&#8217;ve never eaten in one of
those fandangle hotels; and the way you put
it, I&#8217;m just crazy to go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have holiday Saturday afternoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all these downtown places do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, I shall expect you at the
Plaza at one o&#8217;clock. Ask for Miss Galbraith,
and they will show you right up to her rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land! it does seem too good to be true!
Say, Miss Fairfield, I&#8217;ve only got a black mohair
to wear,&mdash;will that do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will. Maybe you&#8217;ve a pretty
bit of embroidery or something to lighten it up
a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve got a linjerry collar and cuffs that
I&#8217;ve just been achin&#8217; to wear ever since my sister
gave them to me last Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall expect you on Saturday, and
I&#8217;m so glad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a smiling bow, Patty started away, but
she saw by Mrs. Greene&#8217;s face, there was something
left unsaid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, kindly, stepping
back again to the counter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; and Mrs. Greene
twisted her fingers a little nervously, &#8220;don&#8217;t
think this is queer,&mdash;but won&#8217;t you wear one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
your real pretty dresses? I do like to see a
pretty, stylish dress,&mdash;and I never get a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; said Patty, heartily; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
a brand-new one that I&#8217;ve never worn, and I&#8217;ll
honour the occasion with it, on Saturday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Patty went away, greatly pleased at
her success.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had quite a buzz, didn&#8217;t yer?&#8221; observed the
red-headed boy, looking at Patty with curiosity,
as she passed him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. By the way, young man, what
is your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosy; should think you&#8217;d know without
askin&#8217;,&#8221; and he grabbed a bunch of his red hair
with a comical grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know whether it was that or
Freckles,&#8221; said Patty, who was moved to chaff
him, by reason of his good-natured <i>camaraderie</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might just as well &#8216;a&#8217; been,&#8221; and Rosy
grinned wider than ever.
</p>
<p>Patty nodded a good-bye, and went on, rapidly
turning over in her mind a new plan that would
include Rosy in some future happy Saturday
afternoon. But this plan must wait for development,
as the coming Saturday was enough to
occupy her thoughts for the present.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Home, Miller,&#8221; she said, as she took her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
seat. Miller gave a relieved sigh, for he was
always more or less afraid of Patty&#8217;s escapades;
and he didn&#8217;t like to have her go alone into
these strange buildings.
</p>
<p>They whizzed homeward, and at luncheon
time Patty gave Nan a graphic account of her
interview with Mrs. Greene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s the funniest of all,&#8221; said Nan,
&#8220;that she should want you to wear your elaborate
clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;We girls had
planned to wear our plainest dresses, thinking
to make our guests feel more at ease. And
when Madame Greene spoke of her black mohair,
I thought I&#8217;d even rip the trimming off
my brown waist! But not so,&mdash;far otherwise.
So I shall get me into that new American Beauty
satin, and I hope to goodness it will suit her
taste. I expect she&#8217;s fearfully critical.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the other girls&#8217; guests won&#8217;t feel as
Mrs. Greene does about this matter. What
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nan, don&#8217;t stir up trouble! I have
only my own guest to look after, and I shall
dress my part. The others will have to do as
seemeth unto them best. Oh, Nan, it&#8217;s going
to be heaps of fun!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if it turns out right,&mdash;without any awkwardness
or embarrassment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you old wet blanket! Now, you know
perfectly well, we&#8217;re doing our best. And if
we&#8217;re awkward, we can&#8217;t help it. We&#8217;re going
this afternoon to get the favours. What do you
think of little pins,&mdash;silver gilt, or enamel?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be all right, or hatpins, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, hatpins everybody has. And they
don&#8217;t show, anyhow. That amethyst one of
mine always hides itself behind a bow or a
feather. No; I&#8217;m sure a nice little round
brooch is the best thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about gloves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or overshoes? or knitted wash-cloths?
Nan, can&#8217;t I bang it into your head that this
affair is for pleasure, not profit? Would you
give <i>your</i> luncheon guests gloves as souvenirs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right, Patty. But it <i>is</i> an
experiment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is! And it&#8217;s going to be a successful
one, and the forerunner of many
others!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Half an hour before luncheon time, Patty
walked into Mona&#8217;s dining-room. She wore
her new gown of American Beauty satin, softly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
draped with a thin black marquisette, and a soft
sash of black satin. Her hat was all black,
with a Beauty rose tucked under the brim, and
resting against her fair hair.
</p>
<p>Mona surveyed her with delight. &#8220;You look
unusually well, Patty,&mdash;but that&#8217;s not saying
anything unusual, for you always look unusually
well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Mona, what kind of English
is that? And a doubtful compliment beside!
But I see you&#8217;re preoccupied, so I shan&#8217;t expect
much appreciation of my new costume. Simple
but tasty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she spoke, Patty was looking at herself in
a long mirror and craning her neck to get a view
of her back. She was fond of pretty clothes,
and her new gown, though rich, was really simple
in line and colouring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your table is beautiful, Mona,&#8221; she said,
suddenly bringing her attention from her own
raiment to the festal preparation.
</p>
<p>The girls had decided that, since Christmas
was only about a fortnight away, it would be attractive
to use Christmas decorations for their
party. And so the round table showed crossed
strips of broad red ribbon, under bands of lace,
and a central decoration of a real Christmas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
tree, with beautiful fancy ornaments and colored
electric lights. At each place was an elaborate
bonbonnière of Christmas red, decked
with sprays of holly. The place cards were
Christmassy; and the little brooches they had
bought, were in dainty boxes tied with holly
ribbon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly lovely, Mona,&#8221; said Patty, enthusiastically.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a bit too much of
anything, and it&#8217;s just as cheery and jolly as
it can be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I wouldn&#8217;t have any flowers on the
table,&#8221; Mona explained, &#8220;for they didn&#8217;t go
with the other things. So, you see, I&#8217;ve these
four big bunches of red carnations around the
room, and I shall give them each one to take
home. Of course, I have boxes ready for
them,&mdash;and then, Patty, I thought we&#8217;d distribute
the Christmas tree decorations among them,&mdash;and
I have the boxes big, so we can put those
and the place-cards and candy-boxes and souvenirs
all in them. And then, you know, it
won&#8217;t seem like <i>giving</i> them things; for you
know yourself how keen people are to take
away their place cards and such things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, indeed! I&#8217;ve been <i>surprised</i> the
people who have <i>everything</i> will gather up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
their cards and trumpery boxes after a luncheon!
And your thoughtfulness is lovely,
Mona. We&#8217;ll each give them our own place-card
and box, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and then, you see, they&#8217;ll have quite a
few little things for their own Christmas, and
that will make them remember the &#8216;bright
spot&#8217; all the more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will! Mona, you&#8217;re a perfect
<i>darling</i>!&#8221; And Patty grasped Mona&#8217;s shoulders
and swung her about in a mad dance of
jubilation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Patty,&#8221; Mona went on, &#8220;Mr. Lansing
wants to help us with our Happy Saturdays
Club. He says he could go with us some
afternoon, to take a lot of newsboys to the
circus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mona Galbraith!&#8221; and Patty stared
at her friend in astonishment. &#8220;Have you
been telling <i>him</i> about our club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; of course, I have. It&#8217;s no secret society,
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but we don&#8217;t want men for members.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Patty, he would be a help. I&#8217;d love
to give some of those poor little newsboys a
good time, and we couldn&#8217;t do it, just by ourselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, Patty thought of &#8220;Rosy,&#8221; and her
idea of including him in some of their plans.
To be sure, it would be better to have a man
to help manage such a project. But not Mr.
Lansing!
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mona,&#8221; she said; &#8220;our club is made
up of just us four girls, and we can find plenty
to do among girls or women. At least, for this
winter. If it&#8217;s all a success, we can do more
next winter, and perhaps get some men to help
us then. If we want to take newsboys to the
circus, father will go with us. Don&#8217;t be everlastingly
dragging in that Mr. Lansing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>not</i> dragging him in! He kindly offered
to help. But of course,&mdash;if you don&#8217;t
want him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t! And, look here, Mona, I
wish you&#8217;d let him alone, yourself. He&#8217;s not
like the men of our set, and I want you to
realise that. Roger says he&#8217;s a bounder,&mdash;if
you know what that is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! Roger is jealous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think he is. But, aside from that, he&#8217;s
right about Mr. Lansing not being the right
kind of a friend for you. Philip Van Reypen
says the same thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! Mr. Van Reypen is an old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
stuck-up! He thinks nobody is any good if
they don&#8217;t begin their names with a Van.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mona, don&#8217;t be silly. I&#8217;m sure I
don&#8217;t know what you see so admirable in Mr.
Lansing, but I do think you ought to be advised
by others who know better than you. Why,
your own father doesn&#8217;t like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know dad doesn&#8217;t; but&mdash;well, all the same,
I <i>do</i>! Why, Patty, he&#8217;s awfully interesting,
and he brings me flowers and candy and
books&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, stop, Mona. You know you don&#8217;t
care for those things! You can have all you
want, without Mr. Lansing&#8217;s gifts. You like
him, because he flatters you, and&mdash;well, I must
admit that he has a way with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Patty, he has! Why, when you
know him, he&#8217;s really fascinating!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let him fascinate you. He&#8217;s
loud, Mona. He&#8217;s not our sort. Now, do
promise me to see less of him, won&#8217;t you? He
seems to be calling on you very often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he does. But how can I stop that? I
can&#8217;t be rude to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can be cool. Every girl can
discourage a man&#8217;s attentions, if she wants
to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m; you seem to know a great deal about
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know what my common sense tells me.
Mona, dear, <i>do</i> drop that man! Why, Roger
is worth a dozen of him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger&#8217;s all right,&mdash;but Mr. Lansing is so,&mdash;so,&mdash;well,
he&#8217;s different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is, indeed! And that&#8217;s the trouble.
The difference is all in Roger&#8217;s favour, if you
only could see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t! Now, look here, Patty.
You know how much I care for you, but I won&#8217;t
have you talking to me like a Dutch Aunt. I
made father bring me to New York this winter,
so I could be near you, and we could have fun
together. But, if you&#8217;re going to scold me all
the time, we won&#8217;t have any fun at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty began to realise that, though Mona
might be coaxed, she could never be driven. So
she concluded to drop the subject, and use more
thought and tact in her endeavours to break up
Mona&#8217;s new friendship.
</p>
<p>And then Clementine Morse came, so the matter
had to be laid aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Jenny here?&#8221; asked Clementine, as she
tossed off her furs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenny who?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My guest, Jenny Bisbee. She&#8217;s the ribbon
girl I told you about. I had the greatest time
to get her off for the afternoon. I had to go
to Walker&#8217;s, you know, and see all sorts of
Heads of Departments. My! they acted like
Crowned Heads! They said it wouldn&#8217;t do at
all,&mdash;it would establish a precedent,&mdash;and all
sorts of things like that. But, somehow or
other, I wheedled them into it, and at last they
said Jenny might come. She was just crazy
about it. She said, she never has any fun in
her life, except looking at the new ribbons when
they come in! Oh, girls, isn&#8217;t it awful <i>never</i>
to have any fun? I expect Jenny will be embarrassed,
but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll enjoy it all. Oh,
how lovely the table looks! Mona, you are a
wonder! I never should have thought of all
those Christmas fixings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like them. Say, Clementine,
don&#8217;t you think it would be nice to have men
members in our club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know. No, I guess not,
though my brother Clifford says it&#8217;s a great
game, and he&#8217;d like to help us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I know another man who wants to
help,&#8221; said Mona, eagerly, when Clementine interrupted
her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it isn&#8217;t that strange being you brought
to Patty&#8217;s party! Wherever <i>did</i> you pick up
that freak, Mona?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>isn&#8217;t</i> a freak! Mr. Lansing is not a rich
man, but he&#8217;s very exclusive. He told me so
himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it!&#8221; and Clementine
laughed merrily. &#8220;As a rule, people who say
themselves that they&#8217;re exclusive, are <i>not</i>.
And one glance at that man is enough to show
his standing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> his standing, then?&#8221; said Mona,
sulkily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside the pale of society, if not outside the
pale of civilisation,&#8221; retorted Clementine, who
was plain-spoken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about Mr. Lansing now,&#8221;
broke in Patty, who feared an unpleasant element
in their pleasant occasion. &#8220;And, anyway,
here comes Elise.&#8221;
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HAPPY GUESTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Elise came in, bringing her guest with
her. The three girls waiting in the sitting-room
were surprised to see the
small, dainty person whom Elise introduced as
Miss Anna Gorman. She had a sweet, sad
little face, and wore a simple one-piece gown of
dove-grey voile. Her hat was grey, also; a
turban shape, with a small knot of pink roses at
one side. Anna was not pretty, but she had a
refined air, and a gentle manner. Though embarrassed,
she strove not to show it, and tried
to appear at ease.
</p>
<p>Mona greeted her cordially: &#8220;How do you
do, Anna?&#8221; she said, for they had agreed to
call the girls informally, by their Christian
names. &#8220;I am glad to see you. Come with
me into the boudoir, and lay off your coat.&#8221;
Mona herself assisted, for she thought it better
not to have her maid about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m well, thank you,&#8221; said Anna, in response
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
to Mona&#8217;s inquiry, and then she broke out, impulsively:
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so happy to be here! It
was so heavenly kind of you young ladies to
ask me. You don&#8217;t <i>know</i> what it means to
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m very glad,&#8221; said Mona, touched
at the girl&#8217;s gratitude. &#8220;Now, I hope you&#8217;ll
just have the time of your life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall, indeed! I know it. I&#8217;m enjoying
every minute, just being in these lovely
rooms, and seeing you kind ladies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Mona&#8217;s manicure girl came. Her name
was Celeste Arleson, and she was a tall, slender
young woman, garbed all in black. It was the
gown she always wore at her work, and, being
of French descent, she had an air of charm that
made her attractive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Celeste; come right in,&#8221; said
Mona, and then she introduced her to Anna.
</p>
<p>The two looked at each other a little shyly,
and then Anna said, &#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; in a
timid way.
</p>
<p>Mona felt embarrassed, too, and began to
wonder if their party would be a failure, after
all.
</p>
<p>But Patty came in then and, with her ever-ready
tact, took the two visitors to the drawing-room,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and began to show them some pictures
and curios.
</p>
<p>Then Jenny Bisbee came, the girl from the
ribbon counter, whom Clementine had invited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, isn&#8217;t this fine!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she
met the others. &#8220;I just do think it&#8217;s fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we could arrange for you to come,&#8221;
said Clementine, cordially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad! My gracious, I guess I&#8217;m glad!
Well! if you measured ribbon from morning
till night, I guess you&#8217;d be glad to get away
from it for once. Why, I measure ribbon in my
dreams, from night till morning. I can&#8217;t seem
to get away from that everlasting stretching out
of thirty-six inches, over and over again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the ribbons are so pretty,&#8221; said Clementine,
by way of being agreeable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; when they first come in. But after a
few weeks you get so tired of the patterns.
My, I feel as if I could throw that Dresden sash
ribbon on the floor and stamp on it, I&#8217;m so
tired of seeing it! And there&#8217;s one piece of
gay brocade that hits me in the eye every morning.
I can&#8217;t stand that piece much longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come round some day, and buy it,&#8221; said
Patty, laughing good-naturedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know the ribbons were so individual to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are. There&#8217;s one piece of light
blue satin ribbon, plain and wide, that I just
love. It&#8217;s a real comfort to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jenny gave a little sigh, as she thought of her
favourite ribbon, and Patty looked at her in
wonderment, that she should be so sensitive to
colour and texture. But her taste in colours
did not seem to extend to her clothes. Jenny
was a pale little thing, with ashy blonde hair,
and large, light blue eyes. She wore a nondescript
tan-coloured dress, without tone or shape;
and she had a weary, exhausted air, as if chronically
tired.
</p>
<p>Conversation was a little difficult. The four
hostesses tried their best to be entertaining without
being patronising, but it was not an easy
task. At least, their advances were not easily
received, and the guests seemed to be on the
alert to resent anything that savoured of patronage.
But help came from an unexpected
quarter. Just at one o&#8217;clock Mrs. Greene
arrived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My land!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she entered
the room, &#8220;if this isn&#8217;t grand! I wouldn&#8217;t of
missed it for a farm! You see, I waited out
on the corner, till it was just one o&#8217;clock. I
know enough to get to a party just on the minute.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
My bringin&#8217; up was good, if I have fell
off a little since. But my folks was always awful
particular people,&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t even take their
pie in their hands. My husband, now, he was
different. He wasn&#8217;t a fool, nor he wasn&#8217;t
much else. But I only had him a year, and
then he up and got killed in a rolling mill.
Nice man, John, but not very forth-putting.
So I&#8217;ve shifted for myself ever since. Not that
I&#8217;ve done so awful well. I&#8217;m slow, I am. I
never was one o&#8217; those to sew with a hot needle
and a scorching thread, but I do my stent right
along. But, my! how I do rattle on! You
might think I don&#8217;t often go in good society.
Well, I don&#8217;t! So I must make the most of
this chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene&#8217;s chatter had been broken in
upon by introductions and greetings, but that
bothered her not at all. She nodded her head
affably at the different ones, but kept right on
talking.
</p>
<p>So Mona was fairly obliged to interrupt her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let us go out to luncheon,&#8221; she said,
after the maid had announced it twice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to,&#8221; said Mrs. Greene. &#8220;Oh, my
land! what a pretty sight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stood stock still in the doorway, and had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to be urged forward, in order that the others
might follow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know a table <i>could</i> look so
handsome!&#8221; she went on. &#8220;My land! I s&#8217;pose
it&#8217;s been thirty years since I&#8217;ve went to a real
party feast, and then, I can tell you, it wasn&#8217;t
much like this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Probably not, for Mona&#8217;s table, with the coloured
electric lights blazing from the pretty
Christmas tree, the soft radiance of the room,
the fragrance of flowers, the exquisite table appointments,
and the pretty, kindly hostesses,
was a scene well worthy of praise.
</p>
<p>Anna Gorman trembled a little as she took her
seat, and sat, wide-eyed, looking almost as if in
a trance of delight. Celeste Arleson was less
embarrassed, as her profession took her into
fine mansions and in presence of fashionable
people every day.
</p>
<p>Jenny Bisbee looked rapturous. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;Oh! I am <i>so</i> happy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The guests all looked a trifle awestruck when
the first course appeared, of grapefruit, served
in tall, slender ice-glasses, each with a red ribbon
tied round its stem, and a sprig of holly in
the bow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, did you ever!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Greene. &#8220;And is this the way they do things
now? Well, well! It does look &#8217;most too
good to eat, but I&#8217;m ready to tackle it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anna Gorman looked a little pained, as if this
homely enthusiasm jarred upon her sense of fitness.
But Mona said hospitably, &#8220;Yes, indeed,
Mrs. Greene,&mdash;it&#8217;s here to be eaten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m free to confess, I don&#8217;t know what
spoon to take,&#8221; Mrs. Greene acknowledged,
looking blankly at the row of flat silver before
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; spoke up Jenny Bisbee, eagerly; &#8220;I
read it in a Sunday paper. You begin at the
outside of the row, and eat in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land! are you sure to come out right, that
way? S&#8217;pose you had a fork left for your ice
cream!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll risk it,&#8221; said Mona, smiling. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
use this spoon at the outside, as Jenny suggests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second course was clam bouillon, and
after it was served, a maid passed a dish of
whipped cream.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene watched carefully as Mona
placed a spoonful on the top of her soup, and
then she exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that don&#8217;t beat all! What is that,
might I ask?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whipped cream,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
have some?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will,&mdash;as you took some. But if
that ain&#8217;t the greatest! Now, just let me tell
you. A friend of mine,&mdash;she has seen some
high society,&mdash;she was telling me a little how to
behave. And she told me of a country person
she knew, who had some soup in a cup once.
And he thought it was tea, and he ca&#8217;mly puts
in milk and sugar! Well, he was just kerflum-mixed,
that poor man, when he found it was
soup! So, my friend says, says she: &#8216;Now,
Almira, whatever you do, <i>don&#8217;t</i> put milk in
your soup!&#8217; And, I declare to goodness, here
you&#8217;re doin&#8217; just that very thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t put any sugar in,&#8221; said
Mona, pleasantly; &#8220;but I think the cream improves
it. You like it, don&#8217;t you, Jenny?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavenly!&#8221; said Jenny, rolling her eyes up
with such a comically blissful expression that
Elise nearly choked.
</p>
<p>As Patty had agreed, the luncheon was good
and substantial, rather than elaborate. The
broiled chicken, dainty vegetables, and pretty
salad all met the guests&#8217; hearty approval and
appreciation; and when the ice cream was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
served, Mrs. Greene discovered she had both a
fork and a spoon at her disposal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; she observed. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t that
handy, now? I s&#8217;pose you take whichever one
you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;You see, there is strawberry
sauce for the ice cream, and that makes it
seem more like a pudding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it does, so it does,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Greene,
&#8220;though, land knows, it ain&#8217;t much like the puddin&#8217;s
I&#8217;m accustomed to. Cottage, rice, and
bread is about the variety we get, in the puddin&#8217;
line. Not but what I&#8217;m mighty grateful to get
those.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like chocolate pudding,&#8221; said Jenny, in a
low voice, and apparently with great effort.
Patty knew she made the remark because she
thought it her duty to join in the conversation;
and she felt such heroism deserved recognition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; she said, smiling kindly at Jenny.
&#8220;In fact, I like anything with chocolate in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; returned Jenny, a little bolder under
this expressed sympathy of tastes. &#8220;Once
I had a whole box of chocolate candies,&mdash;a
pound box it was. I&#8217;ve got the box yet. I&#8217;m
awful careful of the lace paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I often get boxes of candy,&#8221; said Celeste,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
unable to repress this bit of vanity. &#8220;My customers
give them to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My,&#8221; said Jenny, &#8220;that must be fine. Is
it grand to be a manicure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; said Celeste, &#8220;because it takes me
among nice people. They&#8217;re mostly good to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My ladies are nice to me, too,&#8221; observed
Anna. &#8220;I only sew in nice houses. But I
don&#8217;t see the ladies much. It&#8217;s different with
you, Miss Arleson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see nice ladies,&#8221; broke in
Jenny. &#8220;My, how those queens of society can
snap at you! Seems &#8217;if they blame me for
everything: the stock, the price, the slow
cash boys,&mdash;whatever bothers &#8217;em, it&#8217;s all my
fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is unkind,&#8221; said Clementine. &#8220;But
shopping does make some people cross.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it does!&#8221; returned Jenny. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m going to forget it just for to-day. When
I sit here and see these things, all so beautiful
and sparkly and bright, I pretend there isn&#8217;t any
shop or shopping in all the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jenny&#8217;s smile was almost roguish, and lighted
up her pale face till she looked almost pretty.
</p>
<p>Then they had coffee, and snapping crackers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
with caps inside, and they put on the caps and
laughed at each other&#8217;s grotesque appearance.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene&#8217;s cap was a tri-corne, with a gay
cockade, which gave her a militant air, quite in
keeping with her strong face. Patty had a ruffled
night-cap, which made her look grotesque,
and Anna Gorman had a frilled sunbonnet.
</p>
<p>Celeste had a Tam o&#8217; Shanter, which just
suited her piquant face, and Jenny had a Scotch
cap, which became her well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mona, as she rose from the
table, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you each a bunch of
these carnations&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To take home?&#8221; broke in Jenny, unable to
repress her eagerness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and I&#8217;ll have them put in boxes for you,
along with your cards and souvenirs, which, of
course, you must take home also. And, if
there&#8217;s room, I&#8217;ll put in some of these Christmas
tree thingamajigs, and you can use them
for something at Christmas time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Jenny; &#8220;maybe my two kid
brothers won&#8217;t just about go crazy over &#8217;em!
Says I to myself, just the other day, &#8216;What&#8217;s
going in them kids&#8217; stockings is more&#8217;n I know;
but something there must be.&#8217; And,&mdash;here you
are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are!&#8221; said Mona, tucking an extra
snapping cracker or two in Jenny&#8217;s box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to go for a motor ride, now,&#8221; said
Mona. &#8220;I wonder if you girls are dressed
warmly enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All declared that they were, but Mona provided
several extra cloaks and wraps, lest any
one should take cold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two cars for our trip,&#8221; she explained;
&#8220;Miss Farrington&#8217;s limousine and my
own. Has any one any preference which way
we shall go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Greene, &#8220;if you ask me,
I&#8217;d like best to ride up Fifth Avenue. There
ought to be some fine show of dress, a bright
afternoon like this. And there ain&#8217;t anything
I admire like stylish clothes. That&#8217;s a real
handsome gown you got on, Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; said Patty, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. It&#8217;s fashionable of cut, and yet
it ain&#8217;t drawed so tight as some. And a becomin&#8217;
colour, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dandy,&#8221; observed Jenny. &#8220;I see lots
of good clothes on my customers, but they don&#8217;t
all have such taste as Miss Fairfield&#8217;s. And
all you other ladies here,&#8221; she added, politely,
glancing round.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, are we all ready?&#8221; asked Mona, looking
over the group. &#8220;Mrs. Greene, I fear you
won&#8217;t be warm enough, though your jacket <i>is</i>
thick, isn&#8217;t it? But I&#8217;m going to throw this
boa round your neck, by way of precaution.
Please wear it; I have another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My land! if this ain&#8217;t luxuriant,&#8221; and Mrs.
Greene smoothed the neckpiece and muff that
Mona put on her. &#8220;What is this fur, Miss
Galbraith?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is caracul. Do you like it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it? Well, I think it&#8217;s just too scrumptious
for anything. I&#8217;ll remember the feel
of it for a year. And so genteel looking,
too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a good fur,&#8221; said Mona, carelessly
throwing a sable scarf round her own throat.
&#8220;Now, let us start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Down went the eight in an elevator, and Mrs.
Greene was overjoyed to find that she was attended
with quite as much deference as Mona
herself. Elise and Clementine took their guests
in the Farrington car, leaving Patty and Mona,
with their guests, for the Galbraith car.
</p>
<p>Celeste Arleson enjoyed the ride, but she was
not so openly enthusiastic as Mrs. Greene.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; exclaimed that worthy, as she bobbed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
up and down on the springy cushions; &#8220;to
think it&#8217;s come at last! Why, I <i>never</i> expected
to ride in one of these. I saved up once for a
taxicab ride, but I had to use my savings
for a case of grippe, so I never felt to try it
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have grippe?&#8221; said Patty, sympathetically;
&#8220;that was too bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no; it wasn&#8217;t <i>my</i> grippe. Leastways,
I didn&#8217;t have it. It was a lady that lived in the
same boardin&#8217; house, along with me. But she&#8217;d
had misfortune, and lost her money, so I
couldn&#8217;t do no less than to help her. Poor
thing! she was crossed in love and it made her
queer. But that Rosy,&mdash;you know, that redhead
boy, Miss Fairfield?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; returned Patty, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he says she was queered in love, and
it made her cross! She works in our place, you
know. Well, cross she is; and, my land! if she
wasn&#8217;t cross when she had the grippe! You
know, it ain&#8217;t soothin&#8217; on folks&#8217; nerves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;so I&#8217;ve understood.
Well, Mrs. Greene, now you can see plenty of
fashionable costumes. Do you enjoy it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My! I&#8217;m just drinkin&#8217; &#8217;em in! Furs is
worn a lot this year, ain&#8217;t they? Well, I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
wonder. Why, I feel real regal in this fur of
yours, Miss Galbraith. I don&#8217;t know when
I&#8217;ve had such a pleasure as the wearin&#8217; of this
fur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll go through the park and up
Riverside Drive,&#8221; said Mona, as they neared
Eighty-sixth Street. It was pleasant in the
Park, and the fine motors, with their smartly-apparelled
occupants, delighted Mrs. Greene&#8217;s
very soul.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where would you like to go, Celeste?&#8221;
asked Mona; &#8220;or do you like the Park and the
River drive?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I might, Miss Galbraith, I&#8217;d like to go
to Grant&#8217;s Tomb. I&#8217;ve always wanted to go
there, but I never can get a spare hour,&mdash;or if
I do, I&#8217;m too tired for the trip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, you shall. Would you like that,
Mrs. Greene?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, land, yes! I&#8217;ve never been there,
either. Quite some few times I&#8217;ve thought to
go, but something always interferes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So to Grant&#8217;s Tomb they went. The other car
followed, and all went in to look at the impressive
mausoleum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes you feel kind o&#8217; solemn,&#8221; said Mrs.
Greene, as they came out. &#8220;Think of lyin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
there in that eternal rock, as you might say, and
the whole nation comin&#8217; to weep over your
bier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t all weep,&#8221; observed Celeste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in a manner o&#8217; speakin&#8217;, they do,&#8221; said
Mrs. Greene, gently. &#8220;Not real tears, maybe;
but, you know, to weep over a bier, is a figger
of speech; and so far as its meanin&#8217; goes,
Grant&#8217;s got it. And, after all, it&#8217;s the meanin&#8217;
that counts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was nearing sundown as they started down
the Drive, and Mona proposed that they go to
a tea room, and then take their guests to their
several homes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how pretty!&#8221; said Mrs. Greene, as
they all went into the Marie Jeannette Tea
Room.
</p>
<p>The younger girls chose chocolate, but Mrs.
Greene said, &#8220;Give me a cup of tea. There&#8217;s
nothing like it, to my mind. And to think of
having tea in this beautiful place, all decked
with posies. I&#8217;ll just throw this fur a little
open, but keep it over my shoulders. It looks
so luxuriant that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mona ordered dainty sandwiches and little
fancy cakes&mdash;and after a pleasant half-hour
they started homeward. They left Celeste at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
her home first, and then took Mrs. Greene
to hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I live way down on East Eleventh Street,&#8221;
she said, apologetically; &#8220;and I oughtn&#8217;t to let
you go clear down there with me. But,&mdash;oh,
well, I might as well own up,&mdash;I&#8217;d just love to
roll up to our door in this car!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you shall,&#8221; said Mona, appreciating
this bit of feminine vanity. &#8220;And, Mrs.
Greene, if you&#8217;ll accept them, I&#8217;d like to make
you a present of those furs. I don&#8217;t need
them, for I have several other sets, and you&#8217;re
very welcome to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My land!&#8221; said Mrs. Greene, and then
could say no more, for her voice choked, and
two tears rolled down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think I thought you ladies were
stuck up!&#8221; she said, in a voice of contrition.
&#8220;Why, two angels straight from Heaven
couldn&#8217;t be more kind or whole-soulder than you
two are. But, Miss Galbraith, I can&#8217;t accept
such a gift,&mdash;I&mdash;I ought not to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene was caressing the fur as she
spoke, and Mona patted her hand, saying
laughingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take it away from anybody who
loves it as you do. Please keep it. I&#8217;m more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
glad to give it to you than you can possibly be
to have it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Mrs. Greene kept the furs,&mdash;and her
beaming face proved the depth of thankfulness
which she tried, all inadequately, to express.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CONFIDENCES</h3>
</div>

<p>Mona went home with Patty to dinner,
as she often did when the girls had
been together during the afternoon.
</p>
<p>At the dinner table the elder Fairfields were
greatly entertained by the account of the first
Happy Saturday Afternoon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you afraid,&#8221; Mr. Fairfield asked,
&#8220;that such unaccustomed luxuries will make
those people discontented with their own conditions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, father Fairfield,&#8221; exclaimed Patty,
&#8220;you ought to know better than that! you
might as well say that a man in a prison ought
never to see a ray of sunlight, because it would
make him more discontented with his dark
jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed Nan; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
lovely to give these people such a pleasure, and
if I can help in any way, Patty, I&#8217;ll be glad to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then it&#8217;s the memory of it,&#8221; said Mona.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know yourself how pleasant it is to look
back and remember any pleasure you may have
had; and when it&#8217;s only one, and such a big
one, the pleasure of remembrance is even
greater.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good philosophy, Mona,&#8221; said Mr.
Fairfield, approvingly, &#8220;and I take back what
I said. I think the plans you girls have made
are excellent; and I, too, will be glad to help if
I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other people have offered to help us,&#8221; began
Mona, but Patty interrupted her, saying: &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want any help from people individually.
I mean, father, if you will lend us the car, and
things like that, we&#8217;ll be glad, of course. But
we don&#8217;t want any personal assistance in our
plans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, chickadee; far be it from me to
intrude. But I thought perhaps if you wanted
to make a little excursion, say, to see the Statue
of Liberty, or even to go to the circus, you
might like a man along with you as a Courier
General.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what Mr. Lansing said!&#8221; exclaimed
Mona, which was the very remark Patty
had been fearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we&#8217;re <i>not</i> going to do!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
she declared. &#8220;We&#8217;re only going to places
where we can go by ourselves, or if we need a
chaperon, we&#8217;ll take Nan. But we don&#8217;t want
any men in on this deal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why,&#8221; began Mona, but Patty
promptly silenced her by saying, &#8220;You <i>do</i> see
why. Now, Mona, don&#8217;t say anything more
about it. There isn&#8217;t any circus now, and it&#8217;s
time enough when it comes, to decide about
going to it; and I don&#8217;t want to go, anyway.
There are lots of things nicer than a circus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Lansing said he&#8217;d send us a box for the
Hippodrome, some Saturday afternoon,&#8221; said
Mona, a little diffidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s awfully kind of him,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;I
should think you girls would be delighted with
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A box,&#8221; and Patty looked scornful. &#8220;Why,
a box only holds six, so with us four, we could
only invite two guests. I don&#8217;t think much of
that scheme!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll donate a box also,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield.
&#8220;You can get them adjoining, and with two
of you girls in one and two in the other, you
can invite eight guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hesitated. The plan sounded attractive,
and she quickly thought that she could invite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Rosy for one of the guests and give the
boy a Happy Saturday Afternoon. But she
didn&#8217;t want to accept anything from Mr. Lansing,
though she couldn&#8217;t quite bring herself to
say so, frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Patty?&#8221; asked Nan.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t like the idea of the Hippodrome,
though I don&#8217;t see why.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> like it,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but we can&#8217;t decide
these things in a minute. We ought to have a
meeting of the club and talk it over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;You know very
well, Patty, it isn&#8217;t a formal club. I&#8217;m going
to accept these two Hippodrome boxes, and tell
the girls that we can each invite two guests.
The Hippodrome show is lovely this year, and
anybody would like it, whether children or
grown-ups. And we&#8217;re much obliged to you,
Mr. Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking a great deal upon yourself,
Mona,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;You&#8217;re not president of
the club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither are you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I&#8217;m</i> not dictating how things shall be
run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>am</i>! So all you&#8217;ll have to do, is to
run along with me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>Mona was so laughingly good-natured that
Patty&#8217;s serious face broke into a smile, too.
She was annoyed at the idea of being under obligation
to Mr. Lansing, but, after all, it was
hardly fair to stand in the way of eight people&#8217;s
pleasure. So she surrendered gracefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mona,&#8221; she said; &#8220;we&#8217;ll have the
Hippodrome party. I know one guest I shall
invite, who&#8217;s sure to enjoy it. He&#8217;s a boy
about fourteen, and the funniest thing you ever
saw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to take children, too,&#8221; said Mona;
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t know many. I think I&#8217;ll ask
Celeste&#8217;s two little sisters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Patty not to dwell on
anything unpleasant, so having made up her
mind to accept Mr. Lansing&#8217;s favour, she entered
heartily into the plan for the next
party.
</p>
<p>But after dinner, when the girls were alone in
Patty&#8217;s boudoir, she said to Mona, seriously,
&#8220;You know I didn&#8217;t want to take that box
from Mr. Lansing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know it, Patty,&#8221; and Mona
smiled, complacently. &#8220;But I made you do it,
didn&#8217;t I? I knew I should in the end, but your
father helped me unexpectedly, by offering a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
second box. Now, Pattikins, you may as well
stop disliking Mr. Lansing. He&#8217;s my friend,
and he&#8217;s going to stay my friend. He may
have some faults, but everybody has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mona, he isn&#8217;t our sort at all. I don&#8217;t
see <i>why</i> you like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He mayn&#8217;t be your sort, but he&#8217;s mine; and
I like him because I like him! That&#8217;s the only
reason that anybody likes anybody. You think
nobody&#8217;s any good unless they have all sorts of
aristocratic ancestry! Like that Van Reypen
man who&#8217;s always dangling after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t dangling now,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t seen him since my party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t! Is he mad at you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he and Roger are both mad at me; and
all on account of your old Mr. Lansing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Roger&#8217;s mad at me, too, on account of
that same poor, misunderstood young gentleman.
But they&#8217;ll get over it. Don&#8217;t worry,
Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mona, I&#8217;d like to shake you! I might just
as well reason with the Rock of Gibraltar as to
try to influence <i>you</i>. Don&#8217;t you know that
your father asked me to try to persuade you to
drop that Lansing man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had not intended to divulge this confidence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
of Mr. Galbraith, but she was at her wit&#8217;s
end to find some argument that would carry
any weight with her headstrong friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, daddy!&#8221; said Mona, carelessly. &#8220;He
talks to me by the hour, and I just laugh at him
and drum tunes on his dear old bald head. He
hasn&#8217;t anything, really, against Mr. Lansing,
you know; it&#8217;s nothing but prejudice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A very well-founded prejudice, then! Why,
Mona, that man isn&#8217;t fit to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To worship the ground I walk on,&#8221; suggested
Mona, calmly. &#8220;Well, he does, Patty,
so you may as well stop interfering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you look upon it as interfering!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what you call it, if not
that. But I don&#8217;t mind. Go ahead, if it
amuses you. But I&#8217;m sorry if my affairs make
trouble between you and your friends. However,
I don&#8217;t believe Mr. Van Reypen will stay
angry at you very long. And as for Roger,&mdash;well,
I wouldn&#8217;t worry about him. Of course,
you&#8217;re going to Elise&#8217;s dance on Tuesday
night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. And I&#8217;ve no doubt I&#8217;ll
make up with Roger, then; but I don&#8217;t know
about Philip. I doubt if he&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least doubt. Where you are,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
there will Mr. Van Reypen be, also,&mdash;if he can
possibly get an invitation.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Mona was right in her opinion. At Elise&#8217;s
dance on Tuesday night, almost the first man
Patty saw, as she entered the drawing-room,
was Philip Van Reypen. He greeted her pleasantly,
but with a certain reserve quite different
from his usual eager cordiality.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have a dance, Miss Fairfield?&#8221; he
said, holding out his hand for her card.
</p>
<p>Quick-witted Patty chose just the tone that she
knew would irritate him. &#8220;Certainly, Mr.
Van Reypen,&#8221; she said, carelessly, and as she
handed him her card, she turned to smile at
another man who was just coming to speak to
her. When Philip handed back her card, she
took it without looking at it, or at him,
and handed it to Mr. Drayton, seemingly
greatly interested in what dances he might
select.
</p>
<p>Van Reypen looked at her a moment in amazement.
He had intended to be cool toward her,
but the tables were turned, and she was decidedly
cool toward him.
</p>
<p>However, his look of surprise was not lost
upon Miss Patricia Fairfield, who saw him out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of the corner of her eye, even though she was
apparently engrossed with Mr. Drayton.
</p>
<p>And then, as usual, Patty was besieged by several
men at once, all begging for dances, and
her card was quickly filled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>can</i> I do with so many suitors?&#8221; she
cried, raising her hands in pretty bewilderment,
as her card was passed from one to another.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t take all the dances, please; I want to
save some for my special favourites.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning me?&#8221; said Kenneth Harper, who
had just joined the group in time to hear Patty&#8217;s
remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You, for one,&#8221; said Patty, smiling on him,
&#8220;but there are seventeen others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m two or three of the seventeen,&#8221; said
Roger, gaining possession of the card. &#8220;May
I have three, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>One look flashed from Roger&#8217;s dark eyes to
Patty&#8217;s blue ones, and in that glance their
foolish little quarrel was forgiven and forgotten.
</p>
<p>Roger had a big, generous nature, and so had
Patty, and with a smile they were good friends
again.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s mind worked quickly. She had no intention
of giving Roger three dances, but she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
saw that he and Mona were not yet on speaking
terms. So she nodded assent, as he scribbled
his initials in three places, thinking to herself
that before the evening was over, two of them
should be transferred to Mona&#8217;s card.
</p>
<p>Patty was looking lovely in pale blue chiffon
with tiny French rosebuds of pink satin adorning
it here and there. Her golden hair was
clustered in becoming puffs and curls, tucked
into a little net of gold mesh, with coquettish
bunches of rosebuds above each ear.
</p>
<p>But, though Patty was pretty and wore lovely
clothes, her chief charm was her happy, smiling
face and her gay, good-natured friendliness.
She smiled on everybody, not with a set smile of
society, but in a frank, happy enjoyment of the
good time she was having, and appreciation of
the good time that everybody else helped her
to have.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are all so kind to me,&#8221; she was saying
to Robert Kenton, who had just come in; &#8220;and
I want to thank you, Mr. Kenton, for the beautiful
flowers you sent. I do love valley lilies,
they&#8217;re so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re so sentimental,&#8221; suggested Rob
Kenton, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&mdash;if you mean them to be,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Patty, dimpling at him. &#8220;Any flower is sentimental,
if the sender means it so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or if the receiver wants it to be. Did
you?&#8221; and Kenton smiled back at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of <i>course</i> I do!&#8221; And Patty put
on an exaggeratedly soulful look. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>that</i>
sentimental you wouldn&#8217;t believe! But I forget
the language of flowers. What do lilies of
the valley mean,&mdash;especially with orchids in the
middle of the bunch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undying affection,&#8221; responded Kenton,
promptly. &#8220;Do you accept it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad to, but I suppose that means it
lasts for ever and ever,&mdash;so you needn&#8217;t ever
send me any more flowers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t as undying as all that! It needs
to be revived sometimes with fresh flowers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little too complicated for me to think
it out now,&#8221; and Patty smiled at him, roguishly.
&#8220;Besides, here are more suitors approaching;
so if you&#8217;ll please give me back my card, Mr.
Kenton,&mdash;though I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s room
for another one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one?&#8221; said the man who took it, disappointedly;
for sure enough, every space was
filled. &#8220;But there&#8217;ll be an extra or two. May
I have one of those?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I never arrange those in advance,&#8221; said
Patty. &#8220;My partners take their chances on
those. But I&#8217;ll give you half of this dance,&#8221;
and she calmly cut in two the one dance against
which Philip Van Reypen had set his aristocratic
initials.
</p>
<p>Then the dancing began, and what with the
fine music, the perfect floor, and usually good
partners, Patty enjoyed herself thoroughly.
She loved dancing, and being accomplished in
all sorts of fancy dances, could learn any new
or intricate steps in a moment.
</p>
<p>After a few dances she found herself whirling
about the room with Roger, and she determined
to carry out her plan of reconciling him
and Mona. Mr. Lansing was not at the dance,
for Elise had positively declined to invite him;
and so, though Mona was there, she was rather
cool to Elise, and favoured Roger only with a
distant bow as a greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Mona are acting like two silly
idiots,&#8221; was Patty&#8217;s somewhat definite manner
of beginning her conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; said Roger, as he guided her
skilfully round another couple who were madly
dashing toward them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. And, Roger, I want you to take
my advice and make up with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing to make up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you have, too. You and Mona are
good friends, or have been, and there&#8217;s no reason
why you should act as you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a very good reason; and he has most
objectionable manners,&#8221; declared Roger, looking
sulky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like his manners, either; but I tell
you honestly, Roger, you&#8217;re going about it the
wrong way. I know Mona awfully well,&mdash;better
than you do. And she&#8217;s proud-spirited,
and even a little contrary, and if you act
as you do toward her, you simply throw her
into the arms of that objectionable-mannered
man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, Patty, what a speech!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, I don&#8217;t mean literally, but
if you won&#8217;t speak to her at all, on account of
Mr. Lansing, why of course she&#8217;s going to feel
just piqued enough to smile on him all the more.
Can&#8217;t you understand that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her!&#8221; growled Roger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we won&#8217;t let her,&mdash;any such thing!
I don&#8217;t like that man a bit better than you do,
but do you suppose I&#8217;m going to show it by being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
unkind and mean to Mona? That&#8217;s not
tactful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be tactful. I want him to
let her alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t make him do that, unless you
shoot him; and that means a lot of bother all
round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be worth the bother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense, I&#8217;m in earnest. You&#8217;re
seriously fond of Mona, aren&#8217;t you, Roger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am; or rather, I was until that cad
came between us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t exactly a cad,&#8221; said Patty, judicially.
&#8220;I do believe in being fair, and while the man
hasn&#8217;t all the culture in the world, he is kind-hearted
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And awfully good to his mother, let us
hope,&#8221; and Roger smiled, a little sourly.
&#8220;Now, Patty girl, you&#8217;d better keep your pretty
little fingers out of this pie. It isn&#8217;t like you
to interfere in other people&#8217;s affairs, and I&#8217;d
rather you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fiddle-de-fudge, Roger! I&#8217;m not interfering,
and it <i>is</i> my affair. Mona is my affair,
and so are you; and now your Aunt Patty is
going to bring about a reconciliation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on my part,&#8221; declared Roger, stoutly;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MORE MAKING UP</h3>
</div>

<p>After the sixth dance was over, Patty
asked her partner to bring Mr. Everson
to her, and then she awaited his coming
on a little sofa in an alcove.
</p>
<p>If Eugene Everson was surprised at the summons,
he did not show it, but advanced courteously,
and took a seat by Patty&#8217;s side. He
had a dance engaged with her much later in the
evening, so Patty said, pleasantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Everson, don&#8217;t think my request strange,
but won&#8217;t you exchange our later dance for this
number seven?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would gladly, Miss Fairfield, but I&#8217;m engaged
for this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; and Patty favoured him with
one of her most bewitching smiles; &#8220;but the
lady is Miss Galbraith, as I happen to know,
and Miss Galbraith is a very dear friend of
mine, and,&mdash;oh, well, it&#8217;s a matter of &#8216;first aid
to the injured.&#8217; I don&#8217;t want to tell you all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
about it, Mr. Everson, but the truth is, I want
Miss Galbraith to dance this number with another
man,&mdash;because,&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not quite so easy as Patty had anticipated.
She didn&#8217;t want to go so far as to
explain the real situation, and she became suddenly
aware that she was somewhat embarrassed.
Her face flushed rosy pink, and she
cast an appealing glance from her violet-blue
eyes into the amused face of the man beside
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an idea of what it is all about, Miss
Fairfield, but please consider me entirely at the
orders of yourself and Miss Galbraith. A man
at a party is at best but a puppet to dance at the
bidding of any fair lady. And what better fortune
could I ask than to be allowed to obey your
decree?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was greatly relieved when he took the
matter thus lightly. In whimsical conversation
she was on her own ground, and she responded
gaily: &#8220;Let it remain a mystery, then; and
obey as a noble knight a lady&#8217;s decree. Dance
with me, and trust it to me that Miss Galbraith
is also obeying a decree of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a small person, you seem to issue decrees
of surprising number and rapidity,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Everson, who was a large man, looked down at
Patty with an air of amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Patty, demurely, &#8220;I&#8217;m accustomed
to it. Decrees are my strong point. I
issue them &#8217;most all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And are they always obeyed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, noble sir, not always. Though I&#8217;m
not sure that your question is as flattering
as the remarks most young men make to
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. But when you know me better,
Miss Fairfield, you&#8217;ll find out that I&#8217;m very
different from the common herd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? How interesting! I hope I shall
know you better very soon, for I adore unusual
people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do unusual people adore you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell; I&#8217;ve never met one before,&#8221; and
after the briefest of saucy glances, Patty
dropped her eyes demurely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you one yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; And Patty looked up with an
air of greatest surprise; &#8220;I&#8217;m just a plain little
every-day girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a plain little coquette, that&#8217;s what
you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are indeed unusual, sir, to call me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
plain!&#8221; and Patty looked about as indignant as
an angry kitten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, when I know you better, I may
change my opinion of your plainness. Will
you dance now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The music had been playing for some moments,
and signifying her assent, Patty rose,
and they joined the dancers who were circling
the floor. Mr. Everson was a fine dancer, but
he was all unprepared for Patty&#8217;s exquisite perfection
in the art.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Fairfield,&#8221; he said, unable to
suppress his admiration, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anybody
danced like you, except professionals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m a good dancer,&#8221; said Patty,
carelessly; &#8220;and so are you, for that matter.
Do you think they&#8217;ve made up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Galbraith and Mr. Farrington. See,
we&#8217;re just passing them. Oh, I&#8217;m afraid they
haven&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was difficult to judge by the glance they
obtained in passing, but Patty declared that
both Mona&#8217;s and Roger&#8217;s faces looked like
thunder clouds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them a little longer,&#8221; said Mr. Everson,
who began to see how matters stood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps another round, and we will find them
smiling into each other&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when they next circled the long room,
Mona and Roger were nowhere to be seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha,&#8221; said Everson, &#8220;the conservatory for
theirs! It must be all right! Shall we trail
&#8217;em?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if they see
us. Let&#8217;s walk through the conservatory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did so, and spied Mona and Roger sitting
under a group of palms, engaged in earnest
conversation. They were not smiling, but they
were talking very seriously, with no indication
of quarrelling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Patty, with a little
sigh. &#8220;It&#8217;s awfully nice to have friends,
Mr. Everson, but sometimes they&#8217;re a great
care; aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me be your friend, Miss Fairfield,
I&#8217;ll promise never to be a care, and I&#8217;ll
help you to care for your other cares.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, what a complicated offer! If I
could straighten all those cares you speak of, I
might decide to take you as a friend. I think
I will, anyway,&mdash;you were so nice about giving
me this dance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was only too delighted to do so, Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. You know it is in place of our
other one, number sixteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we must have that also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it was a fair exchange. You can get
another partner for sixteen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to. If you throw me over,
I shall sit in a corner and mope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do that! Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what,
I&#8217;ll give you half of sixteen, and you can mope
the other half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Patty&#8217;s next partner claimed her,
and Mr. Everson went away.
</p>
<p>Having done all she could in the matter of
conciliating Mona and Roger, Patty bethought
herself of her own little tiff with Philip Van
Reypen. It did not bother her much, for she
had little doubt that she could soon cajole him
back to friendship, and she assured herself that
if she couldn&#8217;t, she didn&#8217;t care.
</p>
<p>And so, when he came to claim his dance,
which was the last before supper, Patty met
him with an air of cool politeness, which greatly
irritated the Van Reypen pride.
</p>
<p>He had thought, had even hoped, Patty would
be humble and repentant, but she showed no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
such attitude, and the young man was slightly
at a loss as to what manner to assume, himself.
</p>
<p>But he followed her lead, and with punctilious
courtesy asked her to dance, and they stepped
out on to the floor.
</p>
<p>For a few rounds they danced in silence, and
then Philip said, in a perfunctory way:
&#8220;You&#8217;re enjoying this party?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been, up to this dance,&#8221; and Patty
smiled pleasantly, as she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not enjoying yourself now?&#8221;
Philip said, suppressing his desire to shake her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>no</i>, sir!&#8221; and Patty looked at him with
big, round eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to dance with a man who doesn&#8217;t
like me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> like you, you silly child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, you don&#8217;t, either! and I&#8217;m <i>not</i> a silly
child.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not enjoying this dance with
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no use going on with it,&#8221; and
releasing her, Philip tucked one of her hands
through his arm, and calmly marched her into
the conservatory. The seat under the palms
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
was vacant, and as she took her place in one
corner of it, he poked one or two cushions
deftly behind her back and made her entirely
comfortable. Then he sat down beside
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;say you&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you carried on with that horrid man
and spoiled our friendship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t carry on, and he isn&#8217;t a horrid man,
and our friendship isn&#8217;t spoiled, and I&#8217;m not
sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sorry that our friendship isn&#8217;t spoiled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; &#8217;course I&#8217;m not! You don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I
want it to be spoiled, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly did all in your power to
spoil it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Philip Van Reypen, I&#8217;ve
already exhausted myself this evening patching
up one spoiled friendship, and it&#8217;s just about
worn me out! Now if ours needs any patching
up, you&#8217;ll have to do it yourself. I shan&#8217;t raise
a finger toward it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty leaned back among her pillows, looking
lovely and provoking. She tried to scowl at
him, but her dimples broke through the scowl
and turned it into a smile. Whereupon, she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
dropped her eyes, and tried to assume a look
of bored indifference.
</p>
<p>Van Reypen looked at her. &#8220;So she won&#8217;t
raise a finger, won&#8217;t she? And I&#8217;ve got to do
it myself, have I? Well, then, I suppose I&#8217;ll
have to raise her finger for her.&#8221; Patty&#8217;s hand
was lying idly in her lap, and he picked up her
slender pink forefinger slowly, and with an abstracted
air. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how raising a finger
helps to patch up a spoiled friendship,&#8221; he
went on, as if to himself, &#8220;but she seems to
think it does, and so, of course, it does! Well,
now, mademoiselle, your finger is raised,&mdash;is
our quarrel all patched up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip held her finger in one hand, and clasped
her whole hand with the other, as he smiled into
her eyes, awaiting an answer to his question.
</p>
<p>Patty looked up suddenly, and quickly drew
her hand away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unhand me, villain!&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t bother about our friendship! I&#8217;m not
worrying over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t, little girl,&#8221; and Philip&#8217;s voice
rang true. &#8220;Nothing can <i>ever</i> shake it! And
I apologise for my foolish anger. If you want
to affect the society of men I don&#8217;t like,&mdash;of
course I&#8217;ve no right to say a word, and I won&#8217;t.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
At any rate, not now, for I don&#8217;t want to spoil
this blessed making-up with even a thought of
anything unpleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s real nice of you, Philip,&#8221; and
Patty fairly beamed at him. &#8220;It&#8217;s so nice to
be friends again, after being near-not-friends!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, milady, and you made up just in time.
Aunty Van is having an opera party to-morrow
night, and she wants you to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; and Patty put her fingertip
in her mouth, and looked babyishly at
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let that influence you. Decide for
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since <i>you</i> don&#8217;t care whether I go or
not, I believe I won&#8217;t go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Foolish child! Of course you&#8217;ll go. And
then, as you know very well, wild horses
couldn&#8217;t keep me away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do wild horses keep people away?
They must be trained to do it. And <i>then</i>,
they&#8217;re not wild horses any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What foolishness you do talk! Well, will
you go to the opera with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and thank you kindly, sir. Or, rather,
I thank your august aunt for the invitation.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank me. As a matter of fact, I made
up the party. So it&#8217;s really mine, though I
accept Aunty Van&#8217;s box for the occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis well, fair sir. I thank thee greatly.
What may I do for thee in return?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty clasped her hands and looked a pretty
suppliant, begging a favour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me half a dozen more dances,&#8221; replied
Philip, taking her card to look at.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one left,&#8221; said Patty, calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And most of them halves!&#8221; exclaimed
Philip. &#8220;What a belle you are, Patty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All the girls are,&#8221; she returned, carelessly,
which, however, was not quite true. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
tell you what I will do. I&#8217;ll give you half of
number sixteen. That&#8217;s Mr. Everson&#8217;s, but I&#8217;ll
divide it. I told him I should.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You little witch! Did you save it for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;M&mdash;m&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; and Patty slowly wagged her
head up and down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was dear of you! But don&#8217;t you think
for a minute that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to have!
There&#8217;ll be an extra or two, and I claim them
all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear the man talk!&#8221; exclaimed Patty.
&#8220;Why, I do believe they&#8217;re beginning an extra
now! Mr. Van Reypen, won&#8217;t you dance it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
with me?&#8221; Patty jumped up and stood before
him, lightly swaying in time to the music.
</p>
<p>Philip sat looking at her, entranced by the
pretty vision; and even before he could rise,
Kenneth Harper came to Patty, and obeying a
sudden coquettish impulse, she put her hand
lightly on Kenneth&#8217;s shoulder and they danced
away.
</p>
<p>Philip Van Reypen sat looking after them,
smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a transparent child she is,&#8221; he thought
to himself. &#8220;Her pretty little coquetries are
like the gambols of a kitten. Now, she thinks
I&#8217;m going to be annoyed at losing this dance
with her. Well,&mdash;I am,&mdash;but I don&#8217;t propose
to quarrel with her about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Patty and Kenneth came dancing
back again; and Patty calmly told Mr. Van
Reypen it was his turn now.
</p>
<p>Philip took her hand and they started off, and
when that dance was finished it was supper-time.
</p>
<p>As usual, Patty and her most especial friends
grouped in some pleasant corner for supper.
But, looking about, she missed a familiar face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Christine Farley?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;She always has supper with us. Do you know
where she is, Mr. Hepworth?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Gilbert Hepworth drew near Patty, and spoke
in a low voice: &#8220;I think she has gone to the
dressing-room,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d go up
and see her, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little startled at his serious face, Patty ran
upstairs, to Elise&#8217;s room, where she had taken
off her wraps.
</p>
<p>There was Christine, who had thrown herself
on a couch, and buried her face in the pillows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Christine, what is the matter, dear?&#8221;
and Patty laid her hand gently on Christine&#8217;s
hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, don&#8217;t speak to me! I am not fit
to have you touch me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Christine, what <i>do</i> you
mean?&#8221; and Patty began to think her friend
had suddenly lost her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bad, wicked girl! You were my
friend, and now I&#8217;ve done an awful, dreadful
thing! But, truly, <i>truly</i>, Patty, I didn&#8217;t mean
to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine Farley, stop this foolishness! Sit
up here this minute, and tell me what you&#8217;re
talking about! I believe you&#8217;re crazy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine sat up, her pale hair falling from its
bands, and her eyes full of tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve&mdash;I&#8217;ve&mdash;stolen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you goose! <i>do</i> go on! What have you
stolen? A pin from Elise&#8217;s pin cushion,&mdash;or
some powder from her puff-box? Another dab
on your nose would greatly improve your appearance,&mdash;if
you ask me! It&#8217;s as red as a
beet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, don&#8217;t giggle! I&#8217;m serious. Oh,
Patty, <i>Patty</i>, <i>do</i> forgive me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive you <i>anything</i>, if you&#8217;ll tell me
what&#8217;s the matter, and convince me that you
haven&#8217;t lost your mind. Now, Christine, don&#8217;t
you <i>dare</i> ask me to forgive you again, until you
tell me <i>what for</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, you were away all summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so I was,&#8221; agreed Patty, in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have been so busy socially this fall
and winter, I haven&#8217;t seen much of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Patty, still more deeply mystified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and&mdash;Gil&mdash;Mr. Hepworth hasn&#8217;t
either&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Patty, a great light breaking in
upon her; &#8220;oh,&mdash;oh!&mdash;OH!! Christine, do you
<i>mean</i> it? Oh, how perfectly <i>lovely</i>! I&#8217;m <i>so</i>
glad!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re glad?&#8221; and Christine opened her
eyes in amazement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of <i>course</i> I&#8217;m glad, you silly! Did
you think <i>I</i> wanted him? Oh, you Blessed
Goose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, I&#8217;m <i>so</i> relieved. You see, I
thought you looked upon him as your especial
property. I know he cared a lot for you,&mdash;he
still does. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he and I are about as well suited as chalk
and cheese! Whereas, he&#8217;s just the one for
you! Oh, Christine, darling, I&#8217;m delighted!
May I tell? Can we announce it to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! You see, he just told me to-night.
And I felt guilty at once. I knew I had stolen
him from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christine, <i>don&#8217;t</i>! Don&#8217;t say such
things! He wasn&#8217;t mine to steal. We&#8217;ve always
been friends, but I never cared for him
<i>that</i> way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he said; but I felt guilty all
the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, stop it, right now! Mr. Hepworth is
lovely; he&#8217;s one of the best friends I ever had,
and if I have any claim on his interest or affection,
I&#8217;m only too glad to hand it over to you.
Now, brace up, powder your nose, and come
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
down to supper. And you needn&#8217;t think you
can keep this thing secret! I won&#8217;t tell,&mdash;but
your two faces will give it away at once.
Don&#8217;t blame <i>me</i> if people guess it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them, Patty; not to-night. Keep
me by you, and right after supper I&#8217;ll go
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, girlie; just as you like. But don&#8217;t
look at G. H. or you&#8217;ll betray your own dear
little heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>However, they reckoned without the other interested
party.
</p>
<p>When the two girls came downstairs, smiling,
and with their arms about each other, Mr.
Hepworth went to meet them, and drew Christine&#8217;s
arm through his own with an unmistakable
air of proprietorship. Christine&#8217;s blushes,
and Patty&#8217;s smiles, confirmed Hepworth&#8217;s attitude,
and a shout of understanding went up
from their group of intimates.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;but I promised
Christine I wouldn&#8217;t tell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then there were congratulations and good
wishes from everybody, and the pretty little
Southern girl was quite overcome at being so
suddenly the centre of attraction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly lovely,&#8221; said Patty, holding out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
her hand to Hepworth, &#8220;and I&#8217;m as glad for
you as I can be,&mdash;and for Christine, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Patty,&#8221; he returned, and for
a moment he held her eyes with his own. Then
he said, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; again, and turned away.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A DELIGHTFUL INVITATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Patty was singing softly to herself, as
she fluttered around her boudoir at a
rather late hour the next morning.
Robed in a soft blue silk négligée, with her
golden curls tucked into a little lace breakfast
cap, she now paused to take a sip of chocolate
or a bit of a roll from her breakfast tray, then
danced over to the window to look out, or back
to her desk to look up her calendar of engagements
for the day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a flutter-budget you are, Patty,&#8221; said
Nan, appearing at the doorway, and pausing to
watch Patty&#8217;s erratic movements.
</p>
<p>Patty flew across the room and greeted her
stepmother with an affectionate squeeze, and
then flew back and dropped comfortably on the
couch, tucking one foot under her, and thereby
dropping off a little blue silk boudoir slipper as
she did so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan!&#8221; she began, &#8220;it was the most exciting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
party ever! What <i>do</i> you think?
Christine and Mr. Hepworth are engaged!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine! and Gilbert Hepworth!&#8221; and
Nan was quite as surprised at the news as Patty
could desire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it great! and oh, Nan, what <i>do</i>
you think? Christine was all broken up,&mdash;crying
in fact,&mdash;because,&mdash;did you ever know anything
so ridiculous?&mdash;because she thought she
was taking him away from me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan looked at Patty a little curiously.
&#8220;Well; you must know, Patty, he certainly
thought a great deal of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he did! And of course he <i>does!</i>&mdash;You
speak as if he were dead!&mdash;and I think
a great deal of him, and I think a heap of Christine,
and I think they are perfectly suited to
each other, and I think it&#8217;s all just lovely!
Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nan, slowly. &#8220;Then, you didn&#8217;t
care for him especially, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious, Nan, if you mean was I in
love with him, I sure was <i>not!</i> Little girls like
me don&#8217;t fall in love with elderly gentlemen;
and this particular little girl isn&#8217;t falling in love
anyway. Why, Nan, I&#8217;m only just out, and I
do perfectly adore being out! I want three or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
four years of good, solid outness before I even
think of falling in love with anybody. Of
course I shall marry eventually, and be a beautiful,
lovely housekeeper, just exactly like you.
But, if you remember, my lady, you were some
few years older than nineteen when you married
my revered father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough, Patty, and I can tell you
I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t accept any of the young men
who asked me before Fred did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jolly glad, too; and father was in luck
when he got you. But you&#8217;re not going to be
rid of me yet for a long time, I can tell you
that much. Well, more things happened last
night. Philip and I made up our quarrel,&mdash;which
wasn&#8217;t much of a quarrel anyway,&mdash;and
Roger and Mona are pretty much at peace
again; though, if Mona keeps on with that Lansing
idiot, Roger won&#8217;t stand it much longer.
And I&#8217;m going to the opera to-night in the Van
Reypen box, and I&#8217;m going skating to-morrow,&mdash;oh,
there&#8217;s the mail!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty jumped up and ran to take the letters
from Jane, who brought in a trayful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a bunch for you, Nansome,&#8221; and Patty
tossed a lot of letters in Nan&#8217;s lap. &#8220;And a
whole lot of beautiful, fat envelopes for me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
&#8217;Most all invitations, as you can see at a glance.
Two or three requests for charity,&mdash;they show
on the outside, too. A few bills, a few circulars
and advertisements, and all the rest invitations.
Isn&#8217;t it gorgeous, Nan, to be invited to
such heaps of things?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wear yourself out, Patty,&#8221; returned
Nan, a little absent-mindedly, being absorbed in
a letter from her mother.
</p>
<p>Having weeded out the more interesting looking
letters, Patty returned to her sofa, and
curled up there with both feet under her, looking
like a very pretty and very civilised little
Turk. With a slender paper cutter she slashed
all the envelopes, and then went through them
one by one, making running comments of delight
or indifference as she read the various contents.
</p>
<p>But suddenly a more excited exclamation broke
from her. &#8220;Oh, my goodness, gracious, sakes
alive!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Nan, <i>will</i> you listen to
this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, honey, till I finish this letter,&#8221;
and Nan went on reading to herself.
</p>
<p>Patty dashed through eight pages of sprawly
penmanship, and as soon as she finished she read
it all over again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Fairfield, what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;
and Nan folded her own letter and returned it
to its envelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in a nutshell, it&#8217;s a Christmas Country
House Party! Could anything be more delightfuller?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, where, what, when?&#8221; And Nan patiently
awaited further enlightenment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nan, it&#8217;s <i>too</i> gorgeous!&#8221; And Patty&#8217;s
eyes ran through the letter again. &#8220;You know
Adèle Kenerley, who was down at Mona&#8217;s last
summer,&mdash;well, she and Jim have bought a place
at Fern Falls,&mdash;wherever that may be,&mdash;somewhere
up in Connecticut,&mdash;in the Berkshires,
you know. Heavenly in summer, dunno what
it&#8217;ll be in winter. But all the same that&#8217;s where
the house party is, Christmas,&mdash;stay two or
three weeks,&mdash;all our crowd,&mdash;oh, Nan! isn&#8217;t it
beatific!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty bounded to her feet, and gathering up
the sides of her accordion-pleated gown, she
executed a triumphant dance about the room,
winding up by kicking her little blue silk slipper
straight over Nan&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderate your transports, my love,&#8221; Nan
said, calmly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want concussion of the
brain, from being hit by a French heel.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of a compliment to my skilful
ballet dancing,&#8221; and Patty flung herself into the
cushions again. &#8220;But, Nan, you don&#8217;t understand;
everybody&#8217;s going! Elise and Mona and
the boys, and oh, gracious, <i>do</i> show some enthusiasm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said Nan, smiling, &#8220;when
you show enough for a dozen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll call up Mona, she&#8217;ll have something
to say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty reached for the telephone, and in a few
moments both girls were talking at once, and
the conversation ran something like this:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, and, Patty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am! Oh, I don&#8217;t know about
that! If I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But of course if Daisy is there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t help that, and anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tuesday, I suppose; but Adèle said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Monday, Mona, for us, and the
boys&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ll go. You see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, stop such nonsense! Of course he
isn&#8217;t invited, but I&#8217;ll never speak to you again
if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course I will, but I&#8217;ll only stay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all our best frocks, and lots of presents
and, oh, Mona, come on over here, do.
There&#8217;s oceans of things to talk about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I will. Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; And Patty hung up the receiver.
&#8220;She&#8217;s coming over here, Nan; there&#8217;s
so much to plan for, you know. Do help me,
won&#8217;t you? A regular Christmas tree, and all
that, you know; and presents for everybody,
and a dance at the country club, and I don&#8217;t
know what all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will have a lovely time.&#8221; And Nan
smiled with sympathy at the excited girl, whose
sparkling eyes and tumbled hair betokened her
state of mind.
</p>
<p>Mona came over and spent the rest of the
day, and plans were made and unmade and remade
with startling rapidity.
</p>
<p>Mona began to voice regrets that Mr. Lansing
was not invited to the house party, but Patty
interrupted at once:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mona Galbraith, you stop that!
Adèle has a lovely party made up, and you&#8217;re
not going to spoil it by even so much as a reference
to that man! Roger will be there for
Christmas, and if that isn&#8217;t enough for you,
you can stay home!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Elise going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she can&#8217;t. She&#8217;s going South next week
with her mother, and I doubt if Philip Van Reypen
will go. His aunt won&#8217;t want him to leave
her at the holidays. Do you know, I&#8217;m a little
sorry Daisy Dow is up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like her, do you, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, if she&#8217;d like me. But she&#8217;s always
snippy to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause she&#8217;s jealous of you,&#8221; observed
Mona, sapiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! She has no reason to be. I
never interfere with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, don&#8217;t let her bother you.
Hal Ferris will be there. You don&#8217;t know him,
do you? He&#8217;s Adèle&#8217;s brother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never met him. She wrote that he&#8217;d
be there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the dearest boy. Well, he&#8217;s older than
Adèle, but he seems like a boy,&mdash;he&#8217;s so full of
capers. Adèle says it&#8217;s a beautiful big house,
just right for a jolly, old-fashioned Christmas
party.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The days simply flew by as Christmas drew
nearer. There was so much to do socially, and
then there were the Happy Saturday Afternoons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
to be planned and carried out, and the
Christmas shopping to be done.
</p>
<p>This last was greatly added to because of the
house party, for Patty knew the generosity of
her hosts, and she wanted to do her share in the
presentation festivities.
</p>
<p>She undertook to dress a huge doll for baby
May. Nan helped her with this or she never
could have finished the elaborate wardrobe.
She selected a beautiful doll, of goodly size, but
not big enough to be cumbersome to little two-year-old
arms. With her knack for dressmaking
and her taste for colour, she made half a
dozen dainty and beautiful frocks, and also little
coats and hats, and all the various accessories of
a doll&#8217;s outfit.
</p>
<p>She bought a doll&#8217;s trunk and suit-case to contain
these things, and added parasol, furs, jewelry,
and all the marvellous little trinkets that
the toy shop afforded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent so much time and thought on this
doll,&#8221; said Patty, one day, &#8220;that I shall have
to buy things for the others. I can&#8217;t sew any
more, Nan; my fingers are all like nutmeg graters
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child,&#8221; sympathised Nan. &#8220;You have
worked hard, I know, but Adèle will appreciate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
it more than if you had made something
for herself. By all means buy the rest of your
gifts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty bought a beautiful luncheon set of
filet lace and embroidery for Mrs. Kenerley,
and an Oriental antique paper cutter for her
husband.
</p>
<p>She bought a handsome opera bag for Mona
and a similar one for Daisy Dow, that there
might be no rivalry there. She bought a few
handsome and worth-while books for the men
who would be at the party, and attractive trinkets
for the house servants.
</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to these, she had to prepare
a great many gifts for her New York
friends, as well as for her own family and many
of her relatives. But both Patty and Nan enjoyed
shopping, and went about it with method
and common sense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Patty, as they started off
in the car one morning, &#8220;why people make such
a bugbear of Christmas shopping. I think it&#8217;s
easy enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s because you have plenty of
money, Patty. You know, not every one has
such a liberal father as you have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>Patty looked thoughtful. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
it&#8217;s that, Nan; at least, not entirely. I think it&#8217;s
more common sense, and not being fussy.
Now, I give lots of presents that cost very little;
and then, of course, I give a lot of expensive
ones, too. But it&#8217;s just as easy to buy the cheap
ones, if not easier. You just make up your
mind what you want to spend for a certain present,
and then you buy the nicest thing you see
for that amount. It&#8217;s when people fuss and
bother, and can&#8217;t make up their minds among
half a dozen different things, that they get worried
and bothered about Christmas. I do believe
most of their trouble comes from lack of
decision, which is only another way of saying
that they haven&#8217;t common sense or even common
gumption!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Patty, whatever else you may lack,
you certainly have common sense and gumption;
I&#8217;ll give you credit for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Nan; much obliged, I&#8217;m sure. I
wish I could return the compliment, but sometimes
I think you haven&#8217;t much of those things
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan flashed a smile at Patty, entirely unmoved
by this criticism; for she knew that she was
vacillating and sometimes undecided, as compared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
to Patty&#8217;s quick-witted grasp of a subject
and instantaneous decision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I told you,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;what we&#8217;re
going to do next Saturday afternoon? I do
think it&#8217;s going to be lovely. And I do hope
it won&#8217;t make the girls mad, but I don&#8217;t think
it will. You know, Nan, what an awful lot of
things we all get every Christmas that we don&#8217;t
want and can&#8217;t use, although they&#8217;re awfully
pretty and nice. We just lay them away in cupboards,
and there they stay. Well, on Saturday,
we&#8217;re going to take a lot of these things
and give them to people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Christmas presents? Why, Christmas
is two weeks off yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it! Not for presents to themselves,
but presents for them to give to other
people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I begin to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it isn&#8217;t the least bit <i>charity</i>, you see.
Why, one of the people I&#8217;m going to give things
to, is Christine. With her work, and being
engaged and all, she hasn&#8217;t any time to make
things, or even to go shopping, and she can&#8217;t
afford to buy much, anyway. So I&#8217;m going to
give her one or two beautiful silk bags that
were given to me two or three years ago.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
They&#8217;re perfectly fresh, never been out of their
boxes. And I&#8217;m going to give her one or two
beautiful, fine handkerchiefs in boxes, and two
or three lovely books, and two or three pieces
of bric-a-brac, and a Japanese ivory carving.
Don&#8217;t you see, Nan, she can give these to her
friends for Christmas, and it will save her a lot
of trouble and expense. And dear knows, <i>I</i>
don&#8217;t want them! My rooms are chock-a-block
with just such things, now. And I know she
won&#8217;t feel offended, when I tell her about it
straightforwardly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she won&#8217;t be offended with you,
Patty; and I think the idea is lovely. I&#8217;ve a lot
of things put away I&#8217;ll give you. I never
thought of such a thing before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls thought at first that maybe it might
not work, but I talked them around and now
they&#8217;re all in for it. I&#8217;m going to take some
things to Mrs. Greene. I&#8217;ve quite a lot for her,
and I&#8217;ll tell her she can give them all away, or
keep some herself, just as she likes. And I&#8217;ve
things for Rosy, that freckled-faced boy, you
know. I have games and picture-puzzles and
books that I used to have myself. Of course
they&#8217;re all perfectly new. I wouldn&#8217;t give anything
that had been used at all. And we&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
going Saturday afternoon to take these things
around. Mona has lovely things, and so has
Elise. You see, we get so many Christmas and
birthday presents, and card party prizes, and
such things, and I do think it&#8217;s sensible to make
use of them for somebody&#8217;s pleasure instead of
sticking them away in dark cupboards. And,
Nan, what do you think?&mdash;with each lot of
things we&#8217;re going to give a dozen sheets of
white tissue paper and a bolt of holly ribbon
and some little tags so they can fix up real
Christmassy presents to give away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re a wonder,&#8221; said Nan, looking
affectionately at the girl beside her. &#8220;How
do you think of all these things?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Common sense and general gumption,&#8221; returned
Patty. &#8220;Very useful traits, <i>I</i> find
&#8217;em. And here we are at our first shopping
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Assisted by Patty&#8217;s common sense and expeditious
judgment, they accomplished a great
deal that morning, and returned home with their
lists considerably shortened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem funny,&#8221; said Patty, that same
afternoon, &#8220;to be tying up these things almost
two weeks ahead of time. But with all the
newspapers and magazines urging you to do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
your shopping early, and send off your parcels
early, you can&#8217;t really do otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was surrounded by presents of all sorts,
boxes of all sizes, pieces of ribbon, and all sorts
of cards and tags.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick and tired of holly ribbon and red
ribbon,&#8221; she said, as she deftly tied up her
parcels. &#8220;So, this year, I&#8217;m using white satin
ribbon and gilt cord. It&#8217;s an awfully pretty
combination, and these little green and gilt tags
are lovely, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her audience, which consisted of Elise and
Mona, were watching her work with admiration.
They had offered to help, but after an
ineffectual attempt to meet Patty&#8217;s idea of how
a box should be tied up, they abandoned the
effort, and sat watching her nimble fingers fly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to get a position in some shop
where they advertise, &#8216;only experienced parcel
wrappers need apply,&#8217;&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;I never
saw such neat parcels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re evidently going to be an old maid,&#8221;
said Mona, &#8220;you&#8217;re so fussy and tidy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do like things tidy,&#8221; admitted Patty, &#8220;and
if that interferes with my having a husband,
why, of course I&#8217;ll have to give him up. For I
can&#8217;t stand not having things neat about me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you call this room neat?&#8221; asked Elise,
smiling as she looked about at the scattered
boxes and papers, cut strings, and little piles of
shredded tissue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; declared Patty, stoutly. &#8220;This
kind of stuff can be picked up in a jiffy, and
then the room is all in order. This is temporary,
you see. By untidiness, I mean dirt and
dust, and bureau drawers in a mess, and desks
in disorder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; confessed Mona, cheerfully.
&#8220;Not the dirt and dust, perhaps,&mdash;the maids
look after that. But I just <i>can&#8217;t</i> keep my belongings
in their places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither can I,&#8221; said Elise. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
how you do it, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! it&#8217;s no credit to me, I just can&#8217;t
help it. I&#8217;d have a fit if they weren&#8217;t all nice
and in order. And if that means I&#8217;m going to
be an old maid, I can&#8217;t help it,&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
care!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoo-hoo!&#8221; said Elise.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>FERN FALLS</h3>
</div>

<p>Christmas would be on Wednesday,
and it was arranged that Patty and
Mona should go up to Fern Falls on
Monday. Roger and Philip Van Reypen were
to go up on Tuesday for the Christmas Eve
celebration; and the rest of the house-party were
already at the Kenerleys&#8217;.
</p>
<p>The girls started off early in the afternoon,
and a train ride of three hours brought them
to the pretty little New England village of
Fern Falls.
</p>
<p>Jim Kenerley met them with a motor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We hoped for snow,&#8221; he said, as he cordially
greeted the befurred young women who stepped
off the train at the little station. &#8220;So much
more Christmassy, you know. But, at any rate,
we have cold, clear weather, and that&#8217;s something.
Hop in, now. Adèle didn&#8217;t come to
meet you,&mdash;sent all kinds of excuses, which I&#8217;ve
forgotten, but she can tell you herself, when we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
reach the house. Here, I&#8217;ll sit between you,
and keep you from shaking around and perhaps
spilling out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cheery Jim Kenerley bustled them into the
tonneau, looked after their luggage, and then,
taking his own place, drew up the fur robes
snugly, and the chauffeur started off. It was
a four-mile spin to the house, for the village
itself was distant from the station, and the
Kenerleys&#8217; house a mile or so beyond.
</p>
<p>It was cold, but the girls were warmly wrapped
up and didn&#8217;t a bit mind the clear, frosty air,
though in an open car. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t bring the
limousine,&#8221; Mr. Kenerley rattled on. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
abide to be shut up in a stuffy glass house, and
then, you know, people who ride in glass houses
mustn&#8217;t throw stones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see, we girls couldn&#8217;t hit anything
if we did throw a stone,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;At
least, women have that reputation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Jim. &#8220;Can&#8217;t even hit
the side of a barn, so they say. But I expect
you girls that grow up with athletics and basket
ball, and such things, put the old proverbs to
rout.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Daisy?&#8221; asked Mona. &#8220;Same as
ever?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yep; same as ever. Daisy&#8217;s all right,
you know, if things go her way. But if
not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If not, she makes them go her way,&#8221; said
Mona, and Jim laughed and agreed, &#8220;She sure
does!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last they reached the house, which Jim informed
them they had dubbed the Kenerley
Kennel, for no particular reason, except that it
sounded well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have dogs?&#8221; asked Patty, as they
rolled up the driveway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we didn&#8217;t exactly name it after them.
Hello, here are the girls!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adèle and Daisy appeared in the doorway,
and greeted the visitors in truly feminine fashion,
which included much laughter and exclamation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do I come in?&#8221; said a laughing voice,
and a big, laughing man left his seat by the
fireplace and came toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my brother,&#8221; said Adèle, &#8220;by name,
Mr. Harold Ferris,&mdash;but commonly called
Chub.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The name was not inapt, for Mr. Ferris
showed a round, chubby face, with big, dancing
black eyes and ringlets of dark hair clustered on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
his brow. Only his enormous size prevented
his appearance being positively infantile, and his
round, dimpled face was as good-natured as that
of a laughing baby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you&#8217;re the two girls who are to spend
Christmas with us,&#8221; he said, beaming down on
them from his great height. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll
do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked approvingly from Patty&#8217;s flower
face to Mona&#8217;s glowing beauty, and truly it
would have been hard to find two more attractive
looking girls. The sudden transition from
the cold out-of-doors to the warmth of the blazing
fire had flushed their cheeks and brightened
their eyes, and the hearty welcome they received
brought smiles of delight to their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, come away with me,&#8221; said Adèle, &#8220;and
get off your furs and wraps, and make yourselves
pretty for tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Chub, in
an aggrieved tone. &#8220;You&#8217;ll just go upstairs
and hob-nob and talk and gossip and chatter and
babble, and never get down here again! I
know girls! Why, first thing I know, you&#8217;ll be
having your tea sent up there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great idea!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, twinkling her
eyes at him. &#8220;Let&#8217;s do that, Adèle; kimono
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
party, you know. We&#8217;ll see you at dinner time,
Mr. Ferris.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner time, nothing! If you&#8217;re not back
here in fifteen minutes, the whole crowd of you,
I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what will you do?&#8221; laughed Mona.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind,&mdash;you&#8217;ll find out all too
soon. Now, skip, and remember, tea will be
served in just fifteen minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls had really no intention of not returning,
and it was not much more than the allotted
time before Patty and Mona were arrayed in
soft, pretty house-dresses and reappeared in the
great hall, where tea was already being placed
for them.
</p>
<p>The big fireplace had cosy seats on either side,
and the crackling logs and flickering blaze made
all the light that was needed save for a pair of
tall cathedral candles in their antique standards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a duck of a house!&#8221; exclaimed Patty,
as she came down the broad staircase, her soft,
rose-coloured chiffon gown shimmering in the
firelight. She cuddled up in a corner near the
fire, and Hal Ferris brought a cushion to put behind
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be a rose-coloured one,&#8221; he said,
apologetically; &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t see one handy to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
grab, and really this old blue isn&#8217;t half bad for
a background.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged for your kind colour-scheme,&#8221;
said Patty, smiling at him, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll have one
lump, please, and a bit of lemon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Mr. Ferris proved himself tactful as well
as kind, for he divided his attentions impartially
among the four ladies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little shy of men; aren&#8217;t we, Adèle?&#8221; he
said to his sister. &#8220;Even Jim seems to have
disappeared. Not that I mind being the only
pebble on the beach,&mdash;far from it,&mdash;but I&#8217;m
afraid I can&#8217;t prove entertaining enough for
four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doing nobly so far,&#8221; said Patty, cuddling
into her cushion, for she loved luxurious
warmth, like a kitten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two more men are coming to dinner, girls,&#8221;
said their hostess; &#8220;and to-morrow, you know,
we&#8217;ll have two more house-party guests. Don&#8217;t
worry, Chub, you shan&#8217;t be overworked, I
promise you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a pleasant tea hour, the girls went again
to their rooms, ostensibly to rest before dinner,
but really to have what Patty called a kimono
party.
</p>
<p>All in their pretty négligées, they gathered in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
Adèle&#8217;s room and talked as rapidly and interruptingly
as any four girls can.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear from Bill Farnsworth often?&#8221;
asked Daisy of Patty, <i>apropos</i> of nothing but
her own curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often, Daisy,&#8221; returned Patty, of no
mind to pursue the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you ever hear from him?&#8221; persisted
the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sometimes,&#8221; said Patty, carelessly.
&#8220;He sent me flowers for my coming-out party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear from Bill sometimes,&#8221; said Adèle.
&#8220;I asked him to come to this party, but he
couldn&#8217;t possibly leave just now. He&#8217;s awfully
busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing?&#8221; asked Mona.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly,&#8221; answered Adèle.
&#8220;Jim can tell you, but it has something to do
with prospecting of mines. Say, girls, do you
want to see the baby before she&#8217;s put to bed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Of course they did, and they all trooped into
the nursery to admire the tiny mite of humanity,
who looked a picture, with her tumbled curls
and her laughing face, just ready for bed.
</p>
<p>She remembered Patty and Mona, and greeted
them without shyness, clinging to Patty&#8217;s neck
and begging her to stay and sing her to sleep.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>This Patty would have done, but Adèle
wouldn&#8217;t allow it, and ordered the girls back to
their rooms to dress for dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight o&#8217;clock sharp,&#8221; she warned them, &#8220;and
don&#8217;t put on your prettiest gowns; save those
for to-morrow night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty wandered around her room, singing
softly, as she dressed. Looking over her dinner
gowns, she decided upon her second best, a
white marquisette with a garniture of pearl
beads and knots of pale blue velvet. When the
maid came to assist her she was nearly dressed,
and ten minutes before the dinner hour she was
quite ready to go downstairs. &#8220;I may as well
go on down,&#8221; she thought to herself. &#8220;I can
explore the house a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked in at Mona&#8217;s door as she passed,
but as that young woman was just having her
gown put over her head, she didn&#8217;t see Patty,
and so Patty went on downstairs.
</p>
<p>There was no one about, so she strolled
through the various rooms, admiring the big,
pleasant living-room, the cosy library, and then
drifted back to the great hall, which was very
large, even for a modern country house. It
was wainscoted in dark wood, and contained
many antique bits of furniture and some fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
specimens of old armour and other curios. Jim
Kenerley&#8217;s father had been rather a noted collector,
and had left his treasures to his only son.
They had chosen this house as being roomy and
well-fitted for their belongings.
</p>
<p>Patty came back to the great fireplace, and
stood there, leaning her golden head against one
of the massive uprights.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Adèle told me you were a peach,&#8221; exclaimed
a laughing voice, &#8220;but she didn&#8217;t half tell me
how much of a one you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty turned her head slowly, and looked at
Mr. Hal Ferris.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought you were a mannerly boy!&#8221;
she said, in a tone of grave reproach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I do
indeed! I&#8217;m almost a stranger to you, I know;
I ought to have waited until I know you better
to say anything of that sort to you! May I
take it back, and then say it to you again after
I do know you better?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty couldn&#8217;t help smiling at his mock
dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how well shall I have to know you,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;before I can say it to you properly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer that question at once,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
Patty. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to let our acquaintance
proceed, and see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And see how the cat jumps,&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Patty. &#8220;And, by the way,
what a jumper that cat must be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Small wonder, with everybody waiting to see
how she jumps! Oh, pshaw! here comes a
horde of people, and our pleasant tête-à-tête is
spoiled!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; we&#8217;ll have another some time,&#8221;
and Patty gave him a dimpled smile that quite
completed the undoing of Mr. Harold Ferris.
</p>
<p>The &#8220;horde&#8221; proved to be two young men
from nearby country houses, Mr. Collins and
Mr. Hoyt. And then the other members of the
household appeared, and soon dinner was announced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any especial guest of honour,&#8221;
said Mrs. Kenerley, &#8220;for you&#8217;re all so very
honourable. So pair off just as you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hal Ferris jumped a low chair and two footstools
to reach Patty before any one else could.
&#8220;Come in with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know the
way to the dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to be shown,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;You
see, I&#8217;ve never been here before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m being so kind to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
you. To-morrow I&#8217;ll take you up in the tower&mdash;it&#8217;s
great.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, is this place a castle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, but it&#8217;s modelled after an old
château. Really, it&#8217;s a most interesting house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. To-morrow we&#8217;ll explore it
thoroughly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then they took their seats at the table, and
as the party was small, conversation became general.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Patty became aware that Mr. Collins,
who sat on the other side of her, was trying
to attract her attention. He was a mild-mannered
young man, and he looked at her
reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked you a question three times, Miss
Fairfield,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you never even
heard it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you certainly can&#8217;t expect me to answer
it, Mr. Collins,&#8221; and Patty laughed gaily.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you repeat it for me, please? I&#8217;ll
promise to hear it this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, did you ever make a lemon pig?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A lemon pig! No, I never did. How do
you make it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re the maddest fun! I say, Mrs.
Kenerley, mayn&#8217;t we have a lemon?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Collins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, oh, I say, Mrs. Kenerley, if it isn&#8217;t
too much trouble, mayn&#8217;t we have a box of
matches, and two black pins, and a bit of
paper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a colander and a tack hammer and a bar
of soap?&#8221; asked Ferris, but Mr. Collins said,
gravely: &#8220;No, we don&#8217;t want those.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The articles he had asked for were soon provided,
and in the slow, grave way in which he
did everything, Mr. Collins began to make the
strange animal of which he had spoken. The
lemon formed the whole pig, with four matches
for his legs, two black pins for his eyes, and a
narrow strip of paper, first curled round a
match, for his tail. It was neither artistic nor
realistic, but it was an exceedingly comical pig,
and soon it began to squeak in an astonishingly
pig-like voice. Then a tap at the window was
heard, and a farmer&#8217;s gruff voice shouted:
&#8220;Have you my pig in there? My little Lemmy
pig?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded Mr. Collins, &#8220;we have; and
we mean to keep him, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the law of ye,&#8221; shouted the farmer.
&#8220;Me pig escaped from the sty, and I call upon
ye to give him up!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t do it!&#8221; shouted several of the
men in chorus.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, kape him!&#8221; returned the voice of the
farmer, and they heard his heavy tramp as he
strode away.
</p>
<p>Patty looked puzzled. She couldn&#8217;t understand
what it all meant, until Hal Ferris whispered,
&#8220;It was only Collins; he&#8217;s a ventriloquist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Patty, turning to Mr. Collins, delightedly,
&#8220;was it really you? Oh, how do you
do it? I&#8217;ve always wanted to hear a ventriloquist,
and I never did before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you did!&#8221; said a voice from the
other end of the table, and Patty looked up, saying
earnestly, &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; when she realised
that the accusation had really come from
Mr. Collins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what fun!&#8221; she cried, clapping her
hands. &#8220;Do some more!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Adèle, and
Patty looked at her in surprise. &#8220;Why not,
Adèle?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Everybody laughed, and Adèle said: &#8220;You&#8217;re
too easily fooled, Patty. That was Mr. Collins
speaking like me. He knows my voice so
well he can imitate it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better stop it!&#8221; came in a deep growl
from Jim Kenerley&#8217;s end of the table, and Patty
was surprised at such a speech from her urbane
host. Then she realised that that, too, was Mr.
Collins speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just love it!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
wanted to know how to do it. Won&#8217;t you
teach me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t learn,&#8221; said Mr. Collins, smiling
at her.
</p>
<p>And then Patty <i>heard herself</i> say: &#8220;I could
so! I think you&#8217;re real mean!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her bewildered look changed to admiration at
his wonderful imitation of her voice, and the
natural, petulant tone of the remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too wonderful!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some
other time, Mr. Collins, after dinner, maybe,
will you teach me just a little about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; he said, kindly; &#8220;but I warn you,
Miss Fairfield, it isn&#8217;t easy to learn, unless one
has a natural gift for it, and a peculiar throat
formation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t teach her,&#8221; begged Daisy Dow.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be keeping us awake all night with her
practising.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was like Daisy to say something unpleasant;
but Patty only smiled at her, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
practise being an angel, and sing you to sleep,
Daisy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sing like an angel without any practice,&#8221;
said Mona, who was always irritated when
Daisy was what Patty called snippy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you sing, Miss Fairfield?&#8221; said Mr.
Hoyt, from across the table. &#8220;You must join
our Christmas choir, then. We&#8217;re going to
have a glorious old carolling time to-morrow
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to,&#8221; replied Patty, &#8220;if I know
your music.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But after dinner, when they tried some of
the music, they discovered that Patty could sing
readily at sight, and she was gladly welcomed
to the musical circle of Fern Falls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are you staying here?&#8221; asked Mr.
Hoyt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A month, at least,&#8221; Adèle answered for
Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not so long as that,&#8221; Patty protested.
&#8220;A fortnight, at most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Adèle only smiled, and said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see
about that, my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a time, Hal Ferris came to Patty, and
tried to draw her away from the group around
the piano.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re neglecting me shamefully,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;and I&#8217;m the brother of your hostess! Guests
should always be especially kind to the Brother
of a Hostess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221; asked Patty, smiling,
as she walked out to the hall with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit talking to the other people, and devote
yourself to me,&#8221; was the prompt response.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do all your sister&#8217;s guests do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em all to; I only want you to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about <i>my</i> wants?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; <i>what</i> about them? You want to talk
to me, <i>don&#8217;t</i> you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone and smile were so roguishly eager
that Patty felt a strong liking for this big, boyish
chap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk for ten minutes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and then
we&#8217;re going to dance, I believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, and then they&#8217;ll all be after you! I
say,&#8221; and he drew her toward a window, from
where the moonlight could be plainly seen,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out and skate. The ice is fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Skate! You must be crazy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I supposed you&#8217;d say so! But to-morrow
more people are coming, and I&#8217;ll never
see anything of you. Say, how about this?
Are you game to get up and go for an early
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
morning skate, just with me, and not let anybody
else know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like that!&#8221; and Patty&#8217;s eyes sparkled,
for she dearly loved early morning fresh air.
&#8220;Of course, we&#8217;ll tell Adèle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; so she&#8217;ll have some breakfast made for
us. But nobody else. How about eight
o&#8217;clock? Regular breakfast will be at nine-thirty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll be ready at eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meet me in the breakfast-room at eight,
then. Do you know where it is? Just off the
big dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you two hob-nobbing about?&#8221;
asked Daisy, curiously, as she strolled over
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just telling Miss Fairfield about the plan
of the house,&#8221; said Ferris, innocently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
well planned, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Patty.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CHRISTMAS EVE</h3>
</div>

<p>As Patty stepped out of her room into the
hall the next morning, at eight o&#8217;clock,
she found Hal Ferris already tiptoeing
down the stairs. He put his finger to his lip
with a great show of secrecy, which made Patty
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why must we be so careful?&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;We&#8217;re not doing anything wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but it&#8217;s so much more fun to pretend we
are. Let&#8217;s pretend we&#8217;re on a mysterious mission,
and if we are discovered we&#8217;re lost!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they crept downstairs silently, and reached
the breakfast-room, without seeing any one except
one or two of the maids, who were dusting
about.
</p>
<p>Patty had on a trim, short skirt of white cloth
and a blouse of soft white silk. Over this she
wore a scarlet coat, and her golden curls were
tucked into a little scarlet skating cap with a
saucy, wagging tassel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>But in the warm, cheery breakfast-room she
threw off her coat and sat down at the
table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t intend to eat anything,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;but the coffee smells so good, I think I&#8217;ll have
a cup of it, with a roll.&#8221; She smiled at the
waitress, who stood ready to attend to her
wishes, and Hal took a seat beside her, saying
he would have some coffee also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t eat our breakfast now, you know,&#8221;
he went on; &#8220;but we&#8217;ll come back with raging
appetites and eat anything we can find. I say,
this is jolly cosy, having coffee here together
like this! I s&#8217;pose you won&#8217;t come down every
morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; and Patty laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind admitting I hate to get up early. I usually
breakfast in my room and dawdle around until
all hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like a girl!&#8221; said Hal, sniffing a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>am</i> a girl,&#8221; retorted Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure are! <i>Some</i> girl, I should say!
Well, now, Girl, if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held Patty&#8217;s scarlet coat for her while she
slipped in her arms.
</p>
<p>Then he disappeared for a moment, and returned
wearing a dark red sweater, which was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
very becoming to his athletic figure and broad
shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Girl,&#8221; he said, gathering up their
skates, and off they started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearly half a mile to the lake. Are you
good for that much walk?&#8221; Ferris asked, as they
swung along at a brisk pace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, indeed, I like to walk; and I like to
skate, but I like best of all to dance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would,&mdash;you&#8217;re a ripping
dancer. You know, to-night we&#8217;ll have &#8216;Sir
Roger de Coverley&#8217; and old-fashioned dances
like that. You like them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for a change; but I like the new ones
best. Are we going to have any dressing up
to-night? I do love dressing up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad rags, do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I mean fancy costumes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that. Well, old Jim&#8217;s going to be Santa
Claus. I don&#8217;t think anybody else will wear
uncivilised clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to. Can&#8217;t you and I rig up in
something, just for fun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! that would be fun. What
can we be? Romeo and Juliet, or Jack and
Jill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, nothing like that. Something more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
like Christmas, you know. Well, I&#8217;ll think it
over through the day, and we&#8217;ll fix it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Skating on the lake so early in the morning
proved to be glorious exercise. The ice was
perfect, and the crisp, clear air filled them with
exhilaration.
</p>
<p>Both were good skaters, and though they did
not attempt fancy figures, they spent nearly an
hour skating around the lake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best skate I ever had!&#8221; declared
Hal, when they concluded to return home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was fine,&#8221; declared Patty, &#8220;and
by the time we&#8217;ve walked back to the house, I
shall be quite ready for some eggs and bacon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And toast and marmalade,&#8221; supplemented
Ferris.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Daisy will be down. Does she
come down to breakfast usually?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes and sometimes not,&#8221; answered
Ferris, carelessly. &#8220;She&#8217;s a law unto herself,
is Daisy Dow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve known her a long time, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about all our lives. Used to go to
school together, and we were always scrapping.
Daisy&#8217;s a nice girl, and a pretty girl, but she
sure has got a temper.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And a good thing to have sometimes. I
often wish I had more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! you&#8217;re perfect just as you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a pretty speech! If you&#8217;re going
to talk like that, I shall take the longest way
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d willingly agree to that, but I don&#8217;t believe
you&#8217;re in need of further exercise just now.
Come, own up you&#8217;re a little bit tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly enough to call it tired, but if there
is a short cut home let&#8217;s take it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the pretty speeches I&#8217;m to
make to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave those till after breakfast. Or leave
them till this evening and give them to me for
a Christmas gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the mistletoe?&#8221; and Ferris looked
mischievous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Patty, with great dignity.
&#8220;I&#8217;m too grown-up for such foolishness
as that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Ferris.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The appearance of the two runaways in the
breakfast-room was greeted with shouts of surprise.
</p>
<p>Adèle knew they had gone skating, but no one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
else did, and it was supposed they hadn&#8217;t yet
come downstairs.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s glowing cheeks were almost as scarlet
as her coat and cap, while Ferris was grinning
with boyish enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Top o&#8217; the morning to you all,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Me and Miss Fairfield, we&#8217;ve been skating for
an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the lake?&#8221; cried Daisy, in surprise.
&#8220;Why, you must have started before sunrise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not that,&#8221; declared Patty, as, throwing
off her wraps, she took a seat next to Adèle;
&#8220;but long enough to get up a ravenous appetite.
I hope the Kenerley larder is well stocked.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let us all in on this game?&#8221;
asked the host. &#8220;I think a morning skating
party would be just about right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have one
any morning you say. I shall be here for a
fortnight, and I&#8217;ll go any morning you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; declared Mona. &#8220;I hate skating,
and I hate getting up early, so count me
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt if any one goes very soon,&#8221; said
Adèle, &#8220;for I think there&#8217;s a storm coming. It
looks bright out of doors, but it feels like snow
in the air.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; agreed her brother; &#8220;and I hope
it will snow. I&#8217;d like a real good, old-fashioned
snowstorm for Christmas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope it won&#8217;t begin before night,&#8221;
said Adèle. &#8220;We&#8217;ve a lot to do to-day. I
want you all to help me decorate the tree and
fix the presents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we will,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;But, if
I may, I want to skip over to the village on an
errand. Can some one take me over, Adèle, or
must I walk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Daisy, who was of no
mind to be left out of Patty&#8217;s escapades, if she
could help it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Daisy, but you mustn&#8217;t tell what
I buy, because it&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s a secret at Christmas time,&#8221;
said Mr. Kenerley; &#8220;but, Patty, you can have
the small motor, and go over to the village any
time you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As there was room for them all, Daisy and
Mona both accompanied Patty on her trip to
the village, and Hal Ferris volunteered to drive
the car. But when they reached the country
shop, Patty laughingly refused to let any of the
party go inside with her, saying that her purchases
would be a Christmas secret.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>She bought a great many yards of the material
known as Turkey red, and also a whole piece of
white illusion. Some gilt paper completed her
list, and she ran back to the car, the shopkeeper
following with her bundles. They attended to
some errands for Adèle, and then whizzed back
to the house just in time to see the Christmas
tree being put into place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have the tree at five o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
said Adèle, &#8220;on account of baby May. It&#8217;s
really for her, you know, and so I have it before
dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;And where do
we put our presents?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On these tables,&#8221; and Adèle pointed to several
small stands already well heaped with tissue-papered
parcels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll get mine,&#8221; and Patty went
flying up to her room. Mona followed, and
the two girls returned laden with their bundles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What fascinating looking parcels,&#8221; said
Adèle, as she helped to place them where they
belonged. &#8220;Now, Patty, about the tree; would
you have bayberry candles on it, or only the
electric lights?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, have the candles. They&#8217;re so nice and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
traditional, you know. Unless you&#8217;re afraid of
fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; all the decorations are fireproof. Jim
would have them so. See, we&#8217;ve lots of this
Niagara Falls stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adèle referred to a decoration of spun glass,
which was thrown all over the tree in cascades,
looking almost like the foam of a waterfall.
This would not burn, even if the flame of a candle
were held to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly beautiful!&#8221; exclaimed Patty.
&#8220;I never saw anything like it before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They scattered it all over the tree, the men
going up on step-ladders to reach the top
branches.
</p>
<p>The tree was set in the great, high-vaulted hall,
and was a noble specimen of an evergreen.
Hundreds of electric lights were fastened to its
branches; and the thick bayberry candles were
placed by means of holders that clasped the
tree trunk, and so were held firmly and safe.
</p>
<p>Adèle&#8217;s prognostications had been correct.
For, soon after luncheon, it began to snow.
Fine flakes at first, but with a steadiness that betokened
a real snowstorm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; exclaimed Patty, dancing
about. &#8220;I do love a white Christmas. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
won&#8217;t interfere with your guests, will it,
Adèle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; if Mr. Van Reypen and Mr. Farrington
get up from New York without having their
trains blocked by snowdrifts, I imagine our Fern
Falls people will be able to get here for the dinner
and the dance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two men arrived during the afternoon,
and came in laden with parcels and looking
almost like Santa Claus himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had to bring all this stuff with us,&#8221; explained
Roger, &#8220;for fear of delays with expresses and
things. Presents for everybody,&mdash;and then
some. Where shall we put them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Adèle superintended the placing of the parcels,
and the men threw off their overcoats, and
they all gathered round the blazing fire in the
hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is right down jolly!&#8221; declared Philip
Van Reypen. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a real country
Christmas since I was a boy. And this big fire
and the tree and the snowstorm outside make it
just perfect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered the snowstorm,&#8221; said Adèle. &#8220;I
like to have any little thing that will give my
guests pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Awfully good of you, Mrs. Kenerley,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Philip. &#8220;I wanted to flatter myself that I
brought it with me, but it seems not. Have
you a hill anywhere near? Perhaps we can go
coasting to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of hills; but I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s a
sled about the place&mdash;is there, Jim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find some, somehow, if there&#8217;s any
coasting. We may have to put one of the
motor cars on runners and try that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They had sleds at the country store. I saw
them this morning,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;And that reminds
me I have a little work to do on a Christmas
secret, so if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll run away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran away to the nursery, where Fräulein,
the baby&#8217;s governess, was working away at the
materials Patty had brought home that morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Patty, as she closed
the door behind her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve caught my idea
exactly, Fräulein. Now, I&#8217;ll try on mine, and
then, afterward, we&#8217;ll call up Mr. Ferris to try
on his.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At five o&#8217;clock the sounding of a Chinese gong
called everybody to come to the Christmas tree.
</p>
<p>The grown people arrived first, as the principal
part of the fun was to see the surprise and delight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of baby May when she should see the
tree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me sit by you, Patty,&#8221; said Philip Van
Reypen, as they found a place on one of the
fireside benches. &#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you awfully
since you left New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only been gone
twenty-four hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-four hours seems like a lifetime
when <i>you&#8217;re</i> not in New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush your foolishness; here comes the
baby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tree had been illuminated; the electric
lights were shining and the candles twinkling,
when little May came toddling into the hall.
She was a dear baby, and her pretty hair lay in
soft ringlets all over the little head. Her
dainty white frock was short, and she wore little
white socks and slippers. She came forward a
few steps, and then spied the tree and stood
stock still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a booful!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;oh, <i>what</i>
a booful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went up near the tree, sat down on
the floor in front of it, clasped her little fat
hands in her lap, and just stared at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I yike to yook at it!&#8221; she said, turning to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
smile at Patty, in a friendly way. &#8220;It&#8217;s so booful!&#8221;
she further explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want something off it?&#8221; asked
Patty, who was now sitting on the floor beside
the baby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Zes; all of ze fings. Zey is all for me! all
for baby May!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there were no gifts on the
tree, only decorations and lights, but Patty took
one or two little trinkets from the branches, and
put them in the baby&#8217;s lap. &#8220;There,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;How do you like those, baby May?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Booful, booful,&#8221; said the child, whose vocabulary
seemed limited by reason of her excited
delight.
</p>
<p>And then a jingle, as of tiny sleighbells, was
heard outside. The door flew open, and in
came a personage whom May recognised at
once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Claus!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, Santa
Claus!&#8221; And jumping up from the floor, she
ran to meet him as fast as her little fat legs
could carry her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Down on the floor!&#8221; she cried, tugging at
his red coat. &#8220;Baby May&#8217;s Santa Claus! Sit
down on floor by baby May!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim Kenerley, who was arrayed in the regulation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
garb of a St. Nicholas, sat down beside
his little girl, and taking his pack from his back,
placed it in front of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All for baby May!&#8221; she said, appreciating
the situation at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all for baby May,&#8221; returned her
mother, for in the pack were only the child&#8217;s
presents.
</p>
<p>One by one the little hands took the gifts from
their wrappings, and soon the baby herself was
almost lost sight of in a helter-skelter collection
of dolls and teddy bears and woolly dogs and
baa lambs and more dolls. To say nothing of
kittens and candies, and balls, and every sort of
a toy that was nice and soft and pleasant.
</p>
<p>The doll Patty had brought, with its wonderful
wardrobe, pleased the baby especially, and
she declared at once that the doll&#8217;s name should
be Patty.
</p>
<p>Having undone all her treasures, the baby
elected to have a general romp with Santa
Claus, whom she well knew to be her father.
Jim had made no attempt to disguise lest it
should frighten the child, and so his own gay
young face looked out from a voluminous snow-white
wig and long white beard. His costume
was the conventional red, belted coat, edged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
with white fur, and a fur-trimmed red cap with
a bobbing tassel.
</p>
<p>Among the toys was a pair of horse lines with
bells on it, and soon May had her good-natured
father transformed into a riding-horse and galloping
madly round the hall.
</p>
<p>Then all present must needs play games suited
to the calibre of the little one, and Ring around
a Rosy and London Bridge proved to be her
favourites.
</p>
<p>After these unwonted exertions, everybody was
ready for tea, which was then brought in. As
a special dispensation, May was allowed to have
her bread and milk at the same time, with the
added indulgence of a few little cakes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a perfect dear?&#8221; said Patty, as she
stood with the baby in her arms, after tea was
finished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; declared Philip, who stood near.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not much up on kiddies, but she&#8217;s about
the best-natured little piece I ever saw. I
thought they always cried after a big racket like
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She must say good-night now,&#8221; said Adèle.
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite time, and beside, I want her to go
away while her reputation is good. Now,
Maisie May, go to Fräulein and go beddy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Patty take May beddy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, Patty must stay here with mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty take May beddy! <i>Zes!</i>&#8221; The finality
of this decision was unmistakable. The
most casual observer could see that unless it
were complied with the scene might lose something
of its sunshine and merriment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say,&#8221; judicially observed Philip,
&#8220;that unless Miss May has her way this time,
there will be one large and elegant ruction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>must</i> make her obey me,&#8221; said Adèle,
a little uncertainly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddlestrings, Adèle,&#8221; returned Patty;
&#8220;this is no time for discipline. The poor baby
is about worn out with fatigue and excitement.
You know, it has been her busy day. Let&#8217;s
humour her this time. I&#8217;ll take her away, and
I&#8217;ll return anon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anon isn&#8217;t a very long time, is it?&#8221; said
Adèle, laughing, and Hal remarked, &#8220;If it is,
we&#8217;ll all come after you, Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty went away, carrying the now smiling
baby, and Fräulein went along with her, knowing
the little thing would soon drop to sleep,
anyway, from sheer fatigue.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Patty soon returned, saying the country
was saved, and now she was ready for
her presents.
</p>
<p>And then everybody began untying things, and
soon the whole place was knee-deep in tissue
papers and ribbons.
</p>
<p>All exclaimed with delight at their own gifts,
and then exclaimed with delight at the others&#8217;
gifts.
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Kenerley gave Patty one of
those Oriental garments known as a Mandarin
coat. It was of pale blue silk, heavy with elaborate
embroidery and gold braiding, and Patty
was enchanted with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I wanted!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;and
I don&#8217;t care if that <i>is</i> what everybody always
says, <i>I</i> mean it! I&#8217;ve wanted one a long
time. They&#8217;re so heavenly for party wraps or
opera cloaks. Mona has a beauty, but this is
handsomer still.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; admitted Mona; &#8220;and now open
that box, Patty. It&#8217;s my gift to you, and I
want to see if you like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know I shall like it, of course. Why,
Mona Galbraith, if it isn&#8217;t a lace scarf! Real
Brussels point! You generous girl, it&#8217;s <i>too</i>
beautiful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it lovely?&#8221; cried Daisy. &#8220;Now, this
is mine to you, Patty. It isn&#8217;t nearly as handsome;
it&#8217;s just a bag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what a grand one!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, as
she unwrapped the beautiful French confection.
&#8220;I simply adore bags. I can&#8217;t have too many
of them. My goodness! I&#8217;m getting as many
presents as baby May!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sure enough, Patty was surrounded with gifts
and trinkets of all sorts. Philip&#8217;s present was a
small but exquisite water-color in a gilded
frame. Roger gave her a glass and silver
flower-basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave each of you girls exactly the same
thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because I didn&#8217;t want you
scrapping over me. Mrs. Kenerley, I included
you, too, if you will accept one of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were beautiful ornaments, and the four
together were so effective that Adèle declared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
she should use them that night for a dinner
table decoration at their Christmas feast.
</p>
<p>Hal Ferris gave each of the girls a beautiful
book, and everybody had so many presents of
all sorts that it was almost impossible to remember
who gave anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I need is a card catalogue,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;I never can remember which is which, I
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I know another thing,&#8221; said Adèle.
&#8220;If you girls don&#8217;t scamper off and dress, you
won&#8217;t be ready for dinner at eight o&#8217;clock.
And there are lots of guests coming. And
more this evening for the country dance. Now,
disperse, all of you, and put on your prettiest
frocks for Christmas Eve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had a new gown for the occasion, of an
exquisite shade of pink chiffon, which just
matched her cheeks. She did up her hair simply,
with a pink ribbon around it, and a pink
rose tucked over one ear.
</p>
<p>After she was all dressed, she flew to the
nursery for a little confab with Fräulein, who
was working away on the Turkey red.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be done?&#8221; asked Patty, anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, indeed, Miss Patty; in ample time.
And the crowns, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Everything all right?&#8221; inquired a voice in
the doorway, and Hal Ferris stepped into the
nursery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, her eyes sparkling.
&#8220;Fräulein will have them all ready by the time
dinner&#8217;s over. Oh, I do <i>love</i> to dress up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t look any sweeter than you do this
way,&#8221; said Ferris, glancing approvingly at the
little pink dancing frock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so nice and complimentary,&#8221; said
Patty, flashing a smile at him, and then they
went downstairs together.
</p>
<p>Dinner was a real Christmas feast. The table
was properly decorated with red ribbons and
red candles and holly, and everybody had souvenirs
and Christmassy sort of trinkets, and
everybody was very gay and festive, and an air
of Christmas jollity pervaded the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>After dinner they all returned to the great
hall, where the Christmas tree was again lighted
to add to the holiday effect.
</p>
<p>Then Patty and Hal, who had let Adèle into
their secret, slipped away from the crowd, and
ran up to the nursery, where Fräulein was awaiting
them.
</p>
<p>The baby was asleep in the next room, so they
must needs be careful not to awaken her, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
they tiptoed about as Fräulein helped them to
don the robes she had made.
</p>
<p>The Turkey red she had fashioned into a
full-draped cloak, which she adjusted around
Hal&#8217;s broad shoulders. It was trimmed with
white fur, and was caught up on one shoulder,
toga fashion, with a spray of holly. A massive
gilt pasteboard crown she put on his head, and
gave him a long wand or sceptre covered with
gilt paper and topped with a cap and bells.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if they&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m Lord of Misrule,&#8221;
whispered Hal, as he stalked up and
down before the mirror, swishing his draperies
about in regal fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em,&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;I wonder if they&#8217;ll know what I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like an angel,&#8221; said Hal, as he
gazed at her.
</p>
<p>The garment Fräulein had made for Patty
was simply straight, flowing breadths of the
white illusion, which fell straight from her
shoulders, her pink gown beneath giving it a
faint rosy tinge. From her head the illusion
rippled in a long veil, floating down behind, and
there were long angel sleeves of the same material.
</p>
<p>On her head was a small crown of gilt paper,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
with a large gilt star in front, and she carried
a gilt wand with a star on the end.
</p>
<p>But the masterpiece of the costume, and one
that did great credit to the ingenuity of Fräulein,
was a pair of wings that were fastened to
Patty&#8217;s shoulders. They were made of fine net,
covered with fringed tissue paper, which had
the effect of soft white feathers.
</p>
<p>Altogether Patty was a lovely vision, and it is
doubtful if &#8220;The Christmas Spirit&#8221; was represented
more beautifully anywhere on earth that
Christmas Eve.
</p>
<p>She floated about the room, delighted to be
&#8220;dressed up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, flying into the hall, she listened over
the banister till she heard Adèle&#8217;s signal from
the piano.
</p>
<p>Still listening, she heard Adèle begin to sing
softly a carol called &#8220;The Christmas Spirit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Slowly, in time to the music, Patty came down
the great staircase. She paused on the landing,
which was but a few steps from the bottom, and
standing there, motionless as a picture, joined
her voice to Adèle&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>She sang the beautiful carol, Adèle now singing
alto, and the vision of the beautiful Christmas
Spirit, and the tones of Patty&#8217;s exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
voice, gave the guests assembled in the hall a
Christmas memory that they could never forget.
</p>
<p>As the last notes died away, there was a significant
pause, and then a storm of applause
broke out.
</p>
<p>They insisted on another song, but Patty shook
her head laughingly, and the next moment Adèle
played a merry, rollicking march on the piano
and the Lord of Misrule came bounding downstairs.
He had a long trumpet in his hand,
upon which he sounded a few notes, and then
waved his sceptre majestically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Lord of Misrule,&#8221; he announced,
&#8220;and I have come to direct our Christmas
revels. To-night my word is law; you are all
my subjects, and must obey my decrees!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shout of applause greeted this gay banter,
and then as Adèle played a lively strain, the
Lord of Misrule gave a clever clog dance on
the staircase landing.
</p>
<p>Then he sprang down the steps, and clasping
the Christmas Spirit, the two tripped away into
a gay impromptu dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody dance!&#8221; shouted the Lord of
Misrule, brandishing his sceptre aloft, and
obedient to his orders, the others caught the gay
spirit, and soon they were all dancing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>Later they had the country dances&mdash;Virginia
reel, Sir Roger, and others which Patty had
never heard of before, but which she had no
difficulty in learning.
</p>
<p>It was not long, however, before she laid aside
her somewhat uncomfortable wings, and also
the illusion draperies, which did not well survive
the intricacies of the figure dances.
</p>
<p>So, once again in her pretty pink frock, she
entered into the dances with the zest she always
felt for that amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s my turn,&#8221; said Roger, coming up
to her at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to be with a friend again, after
all these strangers,&#8221; she said, as they danced
away. &#8220;Though they&#8217;re awfully nice men, and
some of them are very good dancers. You and
Mona are all right, aren&#8217;t you, Roger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty said this so suddenly that he was caught
off his guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and never will be
until she&#8217;ll consent to cut the acquaintance of
that Lansing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll never do that!&#8221; and Patty wagged her
head positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she can get along without my friendship.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Roger, what&#8217;s the use of acting like
that? Mona has a right to choose her
friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, I believe you like that man yourself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dislike him; at least, not as much as
you do. But I don&#8217;t see any reason for you
to take the matter so seriously. At any rate,
while you&#8217;re up here, forget it, won&#8217;t you, and
be good to Mona.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be good to her fast enough, if she&#8217;ll
be good to me. I think a heap of that girl,
Patty, and I don&#8217;t want to see her in the clutches
of a bad man like Lansing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s a bad man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a fortune-hunter,&mdash;that&#8217;s bad
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, every man that looks at a girl doesn&#8217;t
want to marry her for her money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that man does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then cut him out! Why, Roger, you&#8217;re
worth a dozen Lansings, and if you want to
marry Mona, why don&#8217;t you tell her so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty, do you think I&#8217;d have the ghost
of a chance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do. That is, if Mona has a grain
of sense in that pretty head of hers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&mdash;say, Patty,&mdash;this sounds queer, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
know,&mdash;but you and I are such pals,&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
you just say a good word for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger Farrington! the idea! I never supposed
you were <i>bashful</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was before,&mdash;but I&#8217;m a little afraid
of Mona. She&#8217;s so,&mdash;so decided, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Make her decide in your favour.
But, mark my words, young man, you&#8217;ll never
win her by getting grumpy and sour just because
she smiles on another man. In fact,
you&#8217;d better praise Mr. Lansing. That would
be the best way to make her lose interest in
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Fairfield! I&#8217;m ashamed of you. I
always knew you were a flirt, but anything like
that would be downright deception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fiddle-de-dee! All&#8217;s fair in love and
war. You&#8217;re too matter-of-fact, Roger,&mdash;too
staid and practical. Brace up and tease Mona.
Get her guessing&mdash;and the game will be all in
your own hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know these things, Patty?
You&#8217;re too young for such worldly wisdom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, women are born with a spirit of contrariness.
And, anyway, it&#8217;s human nature.
Now, you jolly Mona up, and stop looking as
if you&#8217;d lost your last friend,&mdash;and then see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
how the cat jumps. Why, what is Hal Ferris
doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Lord of Misrule had jumped up on a table,
and was flourishing his sceptre, and announcing
that he would now issue a few decrees,
and they must immediately be obeyed.
</p>
<p>He said the audience wished to see some well-acted
plays, and he would ask some of the guests
present to favour them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As these dramas are necessarily impromptu,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;you will please come forward and do
your parts as soon as your names are called.
Any delay, hesitation, or tardiness will be punished
to the full extent of the Law of Misrule.
The first play, ladies and gentlemen, will be a
realistic representation of the great tragedy of
&#8216;Jack and Jill.&#8217; It will be acted by Mr. Van
Reypen and Miss Fairfield. Ready! Time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip and Patty went forward at once, for
though they had had no intimation of this act,
they were quite ready to take their part in the
merriment.
</p>
<p>Philip caught up one of the glass baskets which
he had brought up for gifts, and declared that
represented their pail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t mine!&#8221; cried Daisy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
mine smashed!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what happens,&#8221; returned Philip,
&#8220;we must be realistic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take this instead,&#8221; said Jim Kenerley,
offering an antique copper bucket, which was
one of his pet pieces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, it <i>is</i> better. Now, the play begins.
This is an illustrated ballad, you know. Will
somebody with a sweet voice kindly recite the
words?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; volunteered Hal, himself. &#8220;My
voice is as sweet as taffy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began intoning the nursery rhyme, and
Patty and Philip strolled through the hall,
swinging the bucket between them, and acting
like two country children going for water.
They climbed the stairs, laboriously, as if clambering
up a steep hill, and as they went up,
Philip hastily whispered to Patty how they were
to come down.
</p>
<p>She understood quickly, and as the second line
was drawled out they stood at the top of the
stairs. Then when Hal said, &#8220;Jack fell
down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; there was a terrific plunge and
Philip tumbled, head over heels, all the way
downstairs, with the big copper bucket rolling
bumpety-bump down beside him. He was a
trained athlete, and knew how to fall without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
hurting himself, but his mad pitching made it
seem entirely an accidental fall. In the screams
of laughter, the last line could scarcely be heard,
but when Hal said, &#8220;And Jill came tumbling
after,&#8221; Patty poised on the top step, leaning
over so far that it seemed as if in a moment she
must pitch headlong. Her fancy dance training
enabled her to hold this precarious position,
and as she stood, motionless, a beautiful tableau,
everybody applauded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All over!&#8221; cried the Lord of Misrule, after
a moment. &#8220;Curtain&#8217;s down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was only an imaginary curtain, so considering
herself dismissed, Patty came tripping
downstairs, and the broken-crowned Jack stood
waiting to receive her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; he commented. &#8220;How
could you stand in that breakneck position?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you take that breakneck fall?&#8221;
she queried back, and then they sought a nearby
seat to witness the next &#8220;play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the Lord of Misrule, &#8220;we will
have a thrilling drama by Miss Dow and&mdash;well,
she may select her own company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I choose Jim Kenerley,&#8221; said Daisy, suddenly
remembering a little trick they used to do
in school. A whispered word was enough to recall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
it to Jim&#8217;s mind, and in a twinkling he had
snatched a gay silk lamp-shade from an electrolier
and clapped it on his head, and draped
around him a Bagdad couch cover. Then he
caught up a big bronze dagger from a writing-table,
and he and Daisy went to the staircase
landing, which was almost like a stage. Seemingly,
Jim was a fearful bandit, dragging a lady,
who hung back with moans and cries.
</p>
<p>On the landing, he brandished the dagger fearsomely,
and Daisy knelt before him, begging
for mercy. At least, her attitude denoted that,
but all she said was: &#8220;A B C D,&#8221; in a low,
pleading voice. &#8220;E F G!&#8221; shouted Jim, dancing
about in a fierce fury.
</p>
<p>Daisy threw out her arms and fairly grovelled
at his feet, begging, &#8220;H I J K.&#8221; &#8220;L M!&#8221;
shouted Jim; &#8220;N O!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Daisy&#8217;s pretty hair became loosened
from its pins, and fell, a shining mass, down her
back.
</p>
<p>Jim clutched it. &#8220;P Q R!&#8221; he yelled, as he
waved the dagger aloft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;S T!&#8221; moaned Daisy, swaying from side to
side, as if in an agony of fear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;U! V! W!&#8221; and the blade of the dagger
rested against the fair neck, as the dreadful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
brigand, with a fierce shout, attacked his
victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;X Y!&#8221; Daisy shrieked, and then toppled
over, as if killed, while Jim, with a frenzied yell
of &#8220;Z!&#8221; towered, triumphant, above his slain
captive.
</p>
<p>How they all laughed; for it was good acting,
though of course greatly burlesqued. But
both had a touch of dramatic genius, and they
had often given this little exhibition in their
old school days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; said Adèle, who was shaking with
laughter. &#8220;You never did it better, Daisy.
You ought to go on the stage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Daisy smiled and bowed at the applause, and
began to twist up her hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My beloved subjects,&#8221; said the Lord of Misrule,
&#8220;you are sure some actors! I didn&#8217;t
know I had so much talent concealed about my
kingdom. I shall now aim for a higher touch
of histrionic art. Let us stop at nothing! Let
us give the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.
I will command Miss Galbraith to play
the part of Juliet, and if no one volunteers as
Romeo, I&#8217;ll modestly remark that I&#8217;m a ripping
good actor myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; said Roger, calmly; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
already signed for the part,&#8221; and taking Mona&#8217;s
hand, he led her toward the staircase.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; protested Mona. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
a word of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t! Won&#8217;t!&#8221; cried the Lord of Misrule,
in stentorian tones. &#8220;Those words are
not allowed in this my Court. Ha, maiden,
dost desire the dungeon for thine? Dost
hanker after prison fare? Fie! Get to thy
place and take thy cue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mona flung her lace handkerchief on her head
for a little Juliet cap, and accepting a large lace
scarf which a lady offered her as she passed, and
an enormous bunch of roses, which Jim hastily
took from a vase and gave her, they all agreed
she was perfectly costumed for Juliet.
</p>
<p>Upstairs she went, and drawing a chair to the
railing, looked over at Roger below. He had
hastily opened a small cupboard, and caught up
a broad black hat of Adèle&#8217;s, with a long, willowed
ostrich plume. He put it on, so that the
feather hung straight down his face, and he kept
blowing it out of his eyes. Daisy had offered
him a gay, flowered chiffon scarf as he passed
her, and he tied it round his waist like a sash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Romeo! Romeo! Romeo!&#8217;&#8221; began
Mona.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wherefore,&#8217;&#8221; prompted Roger in a stage
whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wherefore,&#8217;&#8221; said Mona, obediently,
&#8220;whence, whither, why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Roger, calmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say
the lines you forget. &#8216;Wherefore art thou
Romeo?&#8217; Now for the second act. I wish to
goodness I could be a glove upon that paw of
yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; queried Mona.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you wouldn&#8217;t give me the mitten. Pardon,
good friends, merely an interpolation.
Back to work now. It was the nightingale
and not a poll parrot that hit you in the
ear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Romeo, Romeo,&#8221; Mona broke in.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to cut you up into little bits of stars,
and decorate the sky with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me but Star, and I&#8217;ll be baptised all over
again. Friends, as we&#8217;re a little shy on lines,
the rest of this will be pantomime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roger then sneaked cautiously upstairs, motioned
to Mona to make no sound, picked up
various impedimenta, including books, vases, a
statuette, and such things as he could find on the
hall tables, added a good-sized rug, and then,
also picking Mona up in his arms, he stealthily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
made his way downstairs again, and the elopement
was successful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, you strong giant!&#8221; cried Patty.
&#8220;How <i>could</i> you carry all those things downstairs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My warriors are all strong men!&#8221; said the
Lord of Misrule. &#8220;They can carry off anything,
and carry on like everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then, as Christmas Eve was well past, and
Christmas Day had begun, the merry guests
went away, and the house party congratulated
itself all round, wished everybody Merry
Christmas, and went away to rest.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>COASTING</h3>
</div>

<p>Christmas morning was as white as the
most picturesque imagination could desire.
A heavy snow had fallen in the
night and lay, sparkling, all over the fields and
hills, so that now, in the sunshine, the whole
earth seemed powdered with diamonds.
</p>
<p>Patty came dancing downstairs, in a dainty little
white morning frock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas, everybody!&#8221; she cried,
as she found the group gathered round the fireplace
in the hall. &#8220;Did you ever see such a
beautiful day? Not for skating,&#8221; and she
smiled at Hal, &#8220;but for snow-balling or coasting
or any old kind of fun with snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; cried Roger. &#8220;Who&#8217;s for a
snow frolic? We can build a fort&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And make a snow-man,&#8221; put in Daisy, &#8220;with
a pipe in his mouth and an old hat on his head.
Why do snow-men always have to have those
two things?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jim Kenerley. &#8220;That&#8217;s
an exploded theory. Let&#8217;s make one this morning
of a modern type, and let him have anything
he wants except a pipe and a battered stove-pipe
hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll give him a cigarette and a Derby,&#8221;
said Patty. &#8220;Oh, here comes the mail! Let&#8217;s
have that before we go after our snow-man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chauffeur came in from a trip to the post-office,
with his hands and arms full of mail,&mdash;parcels,
papers, and letters,&mdash;which he deposited
on a table, and Jim Kenerley sorted them
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaps of things for everybody,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Belated gifts, magazines, letters, and post
cards. Patty, this big parcel is for you; Daisy,
here are two for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May take letters! Let baby May be postman!&#8221;
cried the infant Kenerley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her, Jim,&mdash;she loves to be postman,&#8221;
and Adèle put the baby down from her arms,
and she toddled to her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great scheme!&#8221; said Hal. &#8220;Wait a minute,
midget; I&#8217;ll make you a cap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a few folds, a newspaper was transformed
into a three-cornered cap and placed on
the baby&#8217;s head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re a postman,&#8221; said her uncle.
&#8220;Go and get the letters from the post-office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Letters, p&#8217;ease,&#8221; said the baby, holding out
her fat little hands to her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, kiddums; these parcels are too big
for you; you&#8217;re no parcel-post carrier. But
here&#8217;s a bunch of letters; pass them around and
let every one pick out his own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Obediently, the baby postman started off, and
passing Daisy first, dumped the whole lot in her
lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Toddles,&#8221; said Daisy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll pick out mine, then you take the rest
on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Daisy selected half a dozen or more, and gave
the rest of the lot back to the little one, who
went on round the circle, letting each pick out
his own letters.
</p>
<p>Patty had about a dozen letters, and cards and
greetings of various sorts. Some she tore open
and read aloud, some she read to herself, and
some she kept to open when she might be alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you opened all your letters, Patty?&#8221;
asked Jim, looking at her, quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I saved father&#8217;s and Nan&#8217;s to read by
myself, you people are so distracting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! Father&#8217;s and Nan&#8217;s! Oho! aha!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
And are those the only ones you saved to read
by yourself, young lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved Elise&#8217;s, also,&#8221; said Patty, looking at
him, a little surprised. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you the inquisitive
gentleman, anyway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elise&#8217;s! Oh, yes, Elise&#8217;s! And how about
that big blue one,&mdash;what have you done with
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any big blue one,&#8221; said Patty,
innocently. &#8220;What do you mean, Jim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho! <i>what</i> do I mean? What, <i>indeed</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, stop, Jim,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what you&#8217;re teasing Patty about, but she
shan&#8217;t be teased. If she wants to keep her big
blue letter to herself, she&#8217;s going to keep it,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall,&#8221; said Patty, saucily.
&#8220;That is, I should, if I had any big blue letter,
but I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind big blue letters,&#8221; said Roger,
&#8220;let&#8217;s all go out and play in the snow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So everybody put on wraps and caps and furs
and out they went like a parcel of children to
frolic in the snow. Snow-balling was a matter
of course, but nobody minded a lump of soft
snow, and soon they began to build the snow-man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>He turned out to be a marvel of art and architecture,
and as his heroic proportions were far
too great for anybody&#8217;s hat or coat, they draped
an Indian blanket around him and stuck a
Japanese parasol on the top of his head to protect
him from the sun.
</p>
<p>Roger insisted on the cigarette, and as the snow
gentleman had been provided with a fine set of
orange-peel teeth, he held his cigarette jauntily
and firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go coasting,&#8221; said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you shall,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I sent for
a lot of sleds from the village, and I think
they&#8217;ve arrived.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sure enough, there were half a dozen new
sleds ready for them, and snatching the ropes,
with glee, they dragged them to a nearby
hill.
</p>
<p>It was a long, easy slope, just right for coasting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to be pioneer?&#8221; asked Roger of Patty.
And ever-ready Patty tucked herself on to a
sled, grasped the rope, Roger gave her a push,
and she was half-way down the hill before any
one knew she had started. The rest followed,
and soon the whole party stood laughing at the
bottom of the long hill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The worst is walking up again,&#8221; said Patty,
looking back up the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you say that because it&#8217;s what everybody
says,&mdash;or because you&#8217;re lazy?&#8221; asked Philip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m lazy,&#8221; returned Patty, promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then get on your sled, and I&#8217;ll pull you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not lazy enough for that, I hope!
But I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do; I&#8217;ll race you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! as if I couldn&#8217;t beat you up, and not
half try!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t <i>know</i>! Come on, now, do your
best! One, two, three, go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Each pulling a sled, they started to run uphill;
at least, Philip started to run, and at a good
rate; but Patty walked,&mdash;briskly and evenly,
knowing full well that Philip could not keep up
his gait.
</p>
<p>And she was right. Half-way up the hill,
Philip was forced to slow down, and panting
and puffing,&mdash;for he was a big man,&mdash;he turned
to look for Patty. She came along, and swung
past him with an easy stride, flinging back over
her shoulder, &#8220;Take another sprint, and you
may catch me yet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll catch you, no matter how much I have
to sprint,&#8221; Philip called after her, but he walked
slowly for a few paces. Then, having regained
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
his breath, he strode after her, and rapidly
gained upon her progress. Patty looked over
her shoulder, saw him coming, and began to
run. But running uphill is not an easy task,
and Patty&#8217;s strength began to give out. Philip
saw this, and fell back a bit on purpose to give
her an advantage. Then as they were very near
the top, Patty broke into a desperate run.
Philip ran swiftly, overtook her, picked her up
in his arms as he passed, and plumped her down
into a soft snowbank at the very top of the hill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;that&#8217;s the goal, and you
reached it first!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With your help,&#8221; and Patty pouted a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My help is always at your disposal, when
you can&#8217;t get up a hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a fine help, if I ever had hills
to climb. But I never do. This is a great
exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are other hills than snow hills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose now you&#8217;re talking in allegories.
I never <i>could</i> understand those.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day, when I get a real good chance,
I&#8217;ll explain them to you. May I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip&#8217;s face was laughing, but there was a
touch of seriousness in his tone that made Patty
look up quickly. She found his dark eyes looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
straight into her own. She jumped up
from her snowbank, saying: &#8220;I want to go
down again. Where&#8217;s a sled?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on this one with me,&#8221; said Hal, who
had a long, toboggan sort of an affair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great!&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Where did
you get this double-rigged thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been here all the time, but you&#8217;ve been
so wrapped up in that Van Reypen chap that
you had no eyes for anybody else, or anybody
else&#8217;s sled! I&#8217;m downright jealous of that man,
and I&#8217;ll be glad when he goes home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now, Chub,&#8221; said Patty, coaxingly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t talk to me scoldy! Don&#8217;t now; will
you, Chubsy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, if you like him better than you
do me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, goodness, gracious, sakes alive! I&#8217;ve
known him for <i>years</i>, and I&#8217;ve only known you
a few days!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;ve only known you
a few days, and I&#8217;m head over heels in love
with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, &#8220;but this is sudden!
Do you know, it&#8217;s so awful swift, I don&#8217;t
believe it can be the real thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what the Real Thing is?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t a notion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir-ee. You see, I don&#8217;t want to know
for years yet! <i>Why</i> can&#8217;t people let me
alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else has been bothering you?&#8221; demanded
Hal, jealously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call it a bother! I supposed it was
part of the game. Don&#8217;t all girls have nice
compliments, and flattery kind of speeches from
the young men they know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether they do or not,&#8221;
growled Hal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know; they do, and they don&#8217;t mean
a thing; it&#8217;s part of the game, you know. Now,
I&#8217;ll tell you something. I&#8217;ve known Philip Van
Reypen ever so much longer than I have you,
and yet I like you both exactly the same! And
Roger just the same,&mdash;and Jim just the same!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Martin, the chauffeur, just the same, I
suppose; and Mike, the gardener, just the
same!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; agreed Patty. &#8220;<i>Everybody</i> just the
same! I think that&#8217;s the way to do in this
world, love your neighbour as yourself, and
look upon all men as free and equal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think all girls are equal,&mdash;not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
by a long shot. To my mind they&#8217;re divided
into two classes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What two?&#8221; said Patty, with some curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One class is Patty Fairfield, and the other
class is everybody else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had reached the bottom of the hill before
this, and were sitting on the sled, talking.
Patty jumped up and clapped her hands.
&#8220;That&#8217;s about the prettiest speech I ever had
made to me! It&#8217;s a beautiful speech! I&#8217;m going
right straight up the hill and tell it to everybody!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, <i>don&#8217;t</i>!&#8221; cried Hal, his honest, boyish
face turning crimson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you didn&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; and Patty
was the picture of disappointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did! <i>Of course</i> I did! But girls don&#8217;t
run and tell everything everybody says to
them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they? Well, then, <i>I</i> won&#8217;t. You
see, I haven&#8217;t had as much experience in these
matters as you have! Mustn&#8217;t I <i>ever</i> tell anything
nice that <i>anybody</i> says to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not what <i>I</i> say to you, anyhow! You see,
they&#8217;re confidences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want any more of them just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
now. I came out here for coasting, not for confidences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear, my dear little girl, you&#8217;re destined
all through life to get confidences, whatever you
may go for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a horrible outlook! Well, then,
let me gather my coasting while I may! Come
on, Chubsy, let&#8217;s go up the hill.&#8221; And putting
her hand in Hal&#8217;s, Patty started the upward
journey.
</p>
<p>At the top she declared she was going for one
more ride downhill, and this time with Jim.
&#8220;For,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;I would like <i>one</i>
ride without &#8216;confidences.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Off we go!&#8221; said Jim, as he arranged her
snugly on the toboggan sled, and took his place
in front of her. They had a fine ride down,
and Jim insisted on pulling Patty up again.
She rode part way, and then decided it was too
hard work for him, and jumped off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m good for some walk,&#8221; she said,
as she tucked her arm through his, and they
climbed the hill slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you are, Patty. You&#8217;re strong
enough, only you&#8217;re not as hardy as Daisy and
Adèle. I believe our Western girls are heartier
than you New Yorkers. By the way, Patty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
speaking of the West at large, what made you
tell a naughty story this morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; and Patty looked at him with
wide-open eyes. &#8220;I have a few faults, Jim, a
<i>very</i> few, and <i>very</i> small ones! but truly, storytelling
isn&#8217;t among them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you didn&#8217;t get a big blue letter,&#8221;
pursued Jim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And neither I did,&#8221; protested Patty.
&#8220;What do you mean, Jim, by that big blue letter?
I didn&#8217;t see any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, it&#8217;s none of my business, but you seem
to be in earnest in what you say, so I&#8217;ll tell you
that there certainly was in the mail a big blue
letter for you, addressed in Bill Farnsworth&#8217;s
handwriting. I wasn&#8217;t curious, but I couldn&#8217;t
help seeing it; and I know the dear old boy&#8217;s
fist so well, that I was moved to tease you
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t tease me, Jim, for I didn&#8217;t get any
such letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, where is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. Perhaps baby May
kept it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some of the boys got it and kept
it to tease you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;d do that. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Adèle saved it for me. Well, we&#8217;ll look
around when we get home, but don&#8217;t say anything
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when they reached the house, neither Jim
nor Patty could find the blue letter. Adèle said
she had not seen it, and Patty insisted that no
one else should be questioned. Privately, she
thought that Hal Ferris had received it by mistake
from baby May, and had kept it, because
he, too, knew Bill&#8217;s handwriting, and because,&mdash;well,
of course, it <i>was</i> foolish, she knew,&mdash;but
Hal had said he was jealous of any other man,
and he might have suppressed or destroyed Bill&#8217;s
card for that reason. She felt sure it was not a
letter, but merely a Christmas card. However,
she wanted it, but she wanted to ask Hal for it
herself, instead of letting the Kenerleys ask
him.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Dinner will be at two o&#8217;clock,&#8221; Adèle made
announcement. &#8220;It&#8217;s considered the proper
thing to eat in the middle of the day on a holiday,
though why, I never could quite understand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, the reason is, so the children
can eat once in a while,&#8221; suggested her
brother.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Baby can&#8217;t come to the table. She&#8217;s too
little, and her table manners are informal, to
say the least. However, the tradition still
holds, so dinner&#8217;s at two o&#8217;clock, and you may
as well all go and get dressed, for it&#8217;s after one,
now. There&#8217;ll be a few extra guests, so you
girls will have somebody to dress up for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that,&#8221; said Roger; &#8220;as if we boys
weren&#8217;t enough for any girls to dress up
for!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve seen all our pretty frocks,&#8221;
laughed Patty. &#8220;It&#8217;s only strangers we can
hope to impress with them now. I shall wear
my most captivating gown, if Mr. Collins is
coming. Is he, Adèle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Mr. Hoyt, too; and two more girls.
Skip along, now, and don&#8217;t dawdle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Patty dawdled on the staircase till Ferris
came along, and then she spoke to him in a low
tone. &#8220;Chub, you didn&#8217;t see a stray letter of
mine this morning, did you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;M&mdash;what kind of a letter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a blue envelope, with probably a card
inside. I hadn&#8217;t opened it, so I don&#8217;t know
what was in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how could I tell, when I hadn&#8217;t opened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
it! In fact, that&#8217;s just what I want to
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think I know anything
about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Chub, don&#8217;t tease me! I haven&#8217;t time,
now; and truly, I want that letter! Do you
know anything about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Patty, I don&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t see any letters
addressed to you, except the bunch you had in
your hand. Have you really lost one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, seeing that Hal was serious.
&#8220;Jim told me there was one for me from Mr.
Farnsworth, and I want it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Farnsworth! What&#8217;s he writing to you
for? I didn&#8217;t know you knew him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him very well; I only met him
last summer. And I don&#8217;t know that he did
write to me; it was probably just a card. But
I want it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you seem to. Why, Patty, you&#8217;re
blushing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not any such thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are, too! You&#8217;re as pink as a peach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I only blushed to make you call me a
peach,&mdash;and now that I&#8217;ve succeeded, I&#8217;ll run
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So blushing and laughing both, Patty ran upstairs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to her own room. Hal had been so frank
that she was convinced he knew nothing about
the letter, and she began to fear it must have
been tossed into the fire, with the many waste
papers that were scattered about.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>HIDE AND SEEK</h3>
</div>

<p>All the time Patty was dressing she wondered
about that letter; and when Mona,
ready for dinner, stopped at her door,
Patty drew her into the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mona,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did you get a Christmas
card from Mr. Farnsworth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mona, &#8220;in a big blue envelope.
Daisy had one, too. Didn&#8217;t you get one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Jim said there was one for me, but it
got lost somehow. Thrown in the fire, I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Mona, cheerfully.
&#8220;You can have mine. It isn&#8217;t very pretty, and
Daisy&#8217;s isn&#8217;t either, but I suppose they&#8217;re the
best Bill could find out there in Arizona. Do
you want it now, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it at all, Mona. What would I
want with your card, or Daisy&#8217;s either? But if
Little Billee sent one to me, I&#8217;d like to have it,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you would; but truly, they don&#8217;t
amount to much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim must have been mistaken about there being
one for me,&#8221; said Patty, and then the two
girls went downstairs.
</p>
<p>The Christmas dinner was practically a repetition
of the feast of the night before; but as
Adèle said, how could that be helped if people
would have two Christmas celebrations on successive
days?
</p>
<p>There were four extra guests, who proved to
be merry and jolly young people, and after dinner
Hal declared that his reign as Lord of Misrule
was not yet over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s do any more stunts like we had
last night,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;They wear me out.
Let&#8217;s play easy games, like blindman&#8217;s buff, or
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Copenhagen,&#8221; said Hal, but Patty
frowned at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re too grown-up for such things,&#8221;
she declared, with dignity. &#8220;What do you
say to a nice, dignified game of hide and
seek?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All over the house!&#8221; cried Roger. &#8220;May
we, Mrs. Kenerley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The house is yours,&#8221; said Adèle. &#8220;I reserve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
no portion of it. From cellar to attic,
from drawing-room to kitchen, hide where you
will and seek where you like,&mdash;if you&#8217;ll only
promise not to wake the baby. She&#8217;s taking her
afternoon nap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t seem to mind noise,&#8221; said
Roger. &#8220;We do make an awful racket, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I don&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; said Adèle.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve trained her not to mind noise. But I
mean if your hiding and seeking takes you into
the nursery quarters, do go softly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we will,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;I&#8217;m specially
devoted to that baby, and I&#8217;ll see that
her nap isn&#8217;t disturbed, even if I have to stand
sentry at her door. But what larks to have the
whole house! I&#8217;ve never played it before but
what they wouldn&#8217;t let you hide in this room
or that room. Who&#8217;ll be It?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s an old-fashioned way to play,&#8221;
said Hal. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a better way. Either all
the men hide and the girls find them, or else
the other way around; and, anyway, don&#8217;t you
know, whoever finds who, has to be her partner
or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For life?&#8221; asked Jim, looking horrified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, no!&#8221; said his brother-in-law. &#8220;This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
is a civilised land, and we don&#8217;t select life partners
that way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean just partners for a dance,&#8221; said
Patty, trying to help him out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;it ought to be
more than just a dance; I mean more like a
partner for a,&mdash;for a junketing of some kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said Adèle. &#8220;There&#8217;s to be
a masquerade ball at the Country Club on New
Year&#8217;s Eve, and we&#8217;re all going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing!&#8221; cried Hal. &#8220;Now, whichever
seeker finds whichever hider, they&#8217;ll go in
pairs to the ball, don&#8217;t you see? Romeo and
Juliet, or anything they like, for costumes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t be here,&#8221; and Philip Van Reypen
looked ruefully at Roger. &#8220;We go back
to town to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can come up again,&#8221; said Adèle, hospitably.
&#8220;I hereby invite you both to come
back the day before New Year&#8217;s, and stay as
long as you will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are <i>some</i> hostess!&#8221; declared
Roger, looking grateful. &#8220;I accept with pleasure,
but I doubt if my friend Van Reypen can
get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he!&#8221; cried Philip. &#8220;Well, I rather
guess he can! Mrs. Kenerley, you&#8217;re all sorts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
of a darling, and you&#8217;ll see me back here on the
first train after your invitation takes effect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then hurrah for our game of hide and seek,&#8221;
Hal exclaimed. &#8220;Jim and Adèle, you must be
in it, too. You needn&#8217;t think you can go as
Darby and Joan,&mdash;you must take your chances
with the rest. If you find each other, all right,
but if you find anybody else, that&#8217;s your fate,&mdash;see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; said Adèle, laughing. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I&#8217;d be glad to go with any of you beautiful
young men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, will you listen to <i>that</i>!&#8221; cried her husband.
&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t be outdone in generosity.
I&#8217;ll be proud to escort any one of this
galaxy of beauty,&#8221; and he looked at the group
of pretty girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, we must do it all up proper,&#8221; said Hal.
&#8220;In the first place, we must draw lots to see
whether the girls shall hide or we shall. We
must have it all very fair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He tore two strips of paper, one longer than
the other, and holding them behind him, bade
Adèle choose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; she said, and Hal put forth his right
hand and gave her a paper on which was written
&#8220;Girls.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; went on the master of ceremonies.
&#8220;Now you girls must hide. We&#8217;ll give you
fifteen minutes to tuck yourselves away, and then
we&#8217;re all coming to look for you. As soon
as any man finds any girl, he brings her back
here to the hall to wait for the others. Now,
there&#8217;s no stipulation, except that you must not
go out of the house. Scoot! and remember, in
fifteen minutes we&#8217;ll be after you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The six girls ran away and made for various
parts of the house. The two Misses Crosby,
who had come as dinner guests, looked a little
surprised at this unusual game, and Patty said to
them, kindly: &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind, do you?
You know, you needn&#8217;t really go with the man
who finds you, if you don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said the elder Miss
Crosby. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s fun,&mdash;only if I should
draw that dignified Mr. Van Reypen I&#8217;d be
scared to death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he isn&#8217;t so awfully dignified,&#8221; laughed
Patty. &#8220;That&#8217;s just his manner at first.
When you know him better, he&#8217;s as jolly as anything.
But hurry up, girls, the minutes are flying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls scampered away, some running to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
the attic, others going into wardrobes or behind
sofas, and Patty ran to her own room.
</p>
<p>Then she bethought herself that that was one
of the most likely places they would look for
her, and she was seized with an ambition to baffle
the seekers. With a half-formed plan in her
mind, she slipped out of a side door of her own
room that opened on a small passage leading
to the nursery. In the nursery, she found the
baby asleep in her crib, and the Fräulein lying
down on a couch with a slumber-robe thrown
over her, though she was not asleep.
</p>
<p>Like a flash, Patty&#8217;s plan formed itself. She
whispered to the Fräulein, and with a quick understanding
the good-natured German girl took
off her rather voluminous frilled cap, with its
long muslin streamers, and put it on Patty&#8217;s
head. Then Patty lay down on the couch, with
her face toward the wall, and deep buried in the
pillows. Fräulein tucked the slumber-robe over
her, and then herself disappeared down into the
kitchen quarters.
</p>
<p>The search was rather a long one, for the
house was large, and the girls had chosen difficult
hiding-places.
</p>
<p>The two Crosby girls were found first, because
not knowing the house well, they had simply
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
gone into hall closets, and stood behind some
hanging dresses. They were discovered by Jim
Kenerley and Hal; and if the latter was disappointed
in his quarry, he gave no sign of it.
</p>
<p>The four returned to the hall, and after a
while they were joined by Roger and Mona.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho,&#8221; said Jim, who loved to tease, &#8220;what
a coincidence that you two should find each
other!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy enough,&#8221; said Roger. &#8220;I knew Mona
would choose the very hardest place to find; so I
went straight to the attic to the very farthest,
darkest corner, and there she was, waiting for
me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There I was,&#8221; said Mona, &#8220;but I wasn&#8217;t
waiting for <i>you</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you were waiting for me, I know,&#8221; said
Jim, ironically. &#8220;But never mind, Mona, we&#8217;ll
be partners next time. Hello, Adèle, is that
<i>your</i> terrible fate?&#8221; and they all laughed as
Adèle and Mr. Hoyt came in together, with
cobwebs on their hair and smudges of black on
their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d be so smart, Jim, and I hid
in the coal-bin; but Mr. Hoyt found me! By
the way, we must have that place cleaned; it&#8217;s a
disgrace to the house!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you know, my dear, we don&#8217;t often use
it to receive our guests in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care, it must be cleaned.
There&#8217;s no excuse for cobwebs. Now I must
go and tidy up. I hope they haven&#8217;t wakened
the baby. Oh, here&#8217;s Daisy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Daisy and Mr. Collins came in, laughing, and
Mr. Collins declared he had found Miss Dow
hanging out the third-story window by her finger-tips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort,&#8221; said Daisy. &#8220;I was
out on a kind of little balcony place, that&#8217;s on
top of a bay-window or something,&mdash;but I put
my hands over the sill inside, so that I could say
I was still in the house. Wasn&#8217;t that fair?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fair enough, as long as I found
you,&#8221; said Mr. Collins. &#8220;But when I saw
your hands, I really thought you were hanging
from the sill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Patty?&#8221; asked Daisy, &#8220;and Mr.
Van Reypen? Are they still finding each
other?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw Phil,&#8221; said Roger, &#8220;standing guard
at the nursery door, as he said he would. He
let us each go in and look around, on condition
that we wouldn&#8217;t wake the baby. And the
baby&#8217;s nurse was also asleep on the sofa, so I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
looked around and sneaked out as fast as I
could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then Van Reypen came downstairs.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been delayed,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because I held
the fort for the baby, until every man-jack of
you had been in the nursery. Now I&#8217;m going
to begin <i>my search</i>. Who is there left to
find?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, who, <i>indeed</i>?&#8221; said Jim, looking wise.
&#8220;Oh, <i>nobody</i> in particular! Nobody but that
little Fairfield girl, and <i>of course</i> you wouldn&#8217;t
want to find <i>her</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty!&#8221; exclaimed Philip, as he looked
around at the group. &#8220;Why, she isn&#8217;t here,
is she? Where can that little rascal be? You
fellows have been all over the house, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every nook and cranny,&#8221; declared Mr.
Hoyt. &#8220;It was as a very last resort that I
went to the coal-bin and captured Mrs. Kenerley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Been through the kitchens?&#8221; asked Philip,
looking puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Mr. Collins. &#8220;They&#8217;re full
of startled-looking servants who seemed to
think I was a lunatic, or a gentleman burglar,&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know which.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course she&#8217;s got to be found,&#8221; said
Philip. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use looking in the obvious
places, for Patty&#8217;s just cute enough to
pick out a most unexpected hiding-place.
Come on, Roger; you found your girl,&mdash;help
me with mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t fair to have help,&#8221; said Hal.
&#8220;Alone upon your quest you go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I go, then.&#8221; And Philip ran upstairs
three at a time. He went first to the attics, and
made a systematic search of every hall, room,
and closet. He even peeped into the great
tank, as if Patty might have been transformed
into a mermaid. Then followed a thorough
search of the second story, with all its rambling
ells and side corridors; he tiptoed through the
nursery, smiling at the sleeping baby and casting
a casual glance at the still figure on the
couch with the long, white cap-strings falling to
the floor.
</p>
<p>On he went, through the various rooms, and
at last, with slow step, came down into the hall
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she had one of those contraptions
like the Peter Pan fairies,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and flew
right out through the roof and up into the sky!
But I haven&#8217;t searched this floor yet. May I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
go into the dining-room and kitchens, Mrs.
Kenerley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere,&#8221; said Adèle. &#8220;You know I
made no reservations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip strode through the rooms, looked under
the dining-room table and into the sideboard
cupboards; on through the butler&#8217;s pantry, and
into the kitchens. Needless to say, he found
no Patty, and returned, looking more puzzled
than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going down cellar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something
tells me that Patty couldn&#8217;t possibly stay
down there all this time! It&#8217;s more than an
hour since she hid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it?&#8221; inquired
Jim. &#8220;Give it up? I&#8217;ll ring the Chinese
gong for her to come back to us.
That was to be a signal in case of an emergency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to reason
this thing out. Give me a few minutes to think,
and I believe I can find her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t anybody disturb him, let him think!&#8221;
said Mona, gaily, and going to the piano, she
began to play &#8220;Alice, where art thou?&#8221; in
wailing strains that made them all laugh.
</p>
<p>All at once Philip jumped up. &#8220;I know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
where she is!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Sit still all of
you, and I&#8217;ll bring her back with me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said Adèle, curiously.
&#8220;How did you find it out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> know where she is?&#8221; and Philip
looked at her intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea,&#8221; said Adèle,
honestly. &#8220;But I wondered how you could
know, just from thinking about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clairvoyance,&#8221; said Philip, with a mock
air of mystery. &#8220;You see, I know all the
places where she <i>isn&#8217;t</i>, so the one place I have
in mind must be where she <i>is</i>. By the way,
Mrs. Kenerley; baby always takes an afternoon
nap, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, always.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And does the Fräulein, her nurse, always
take a nap at the same time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! She never naps in the daytime.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She did to-day,&#8221; began Roger, but Philip
was already flying upstairs again.
</p>
<p>He went softly into the nursery. The baby
was still asleep, the figure on the couch still lay
quietly beneath the knitted afghan.
</p>
<p>Philip went over and stood beside the couch.
The face was buried in the pillow, but beneath
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the edge of the cap he saw some stray golden
curls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; he mused, in a low voice, but entirely
audible to Patty. &#8220;I thought baby
May&#8217;s nurse had dark hair. She must have
bleached it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty gave no sign that she heard, but cuddled
her head more deeply in the soft pillows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t the Fräulein at all!&#8221; said
Philip, in tones of great surprise. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
Sleeping Beauty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still Patty gave no intimation of being awake,
though, of course, she was.
</p>
<p>Then Philip leaned down over her and murmured:
&#8220;And I&#8217;m the Prince; and when the
Prince finds the Sleeping Beauty, there&#8217;s only
one course for him to pursue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this, Patty opened her eyes and prepared
to spring up, but she was not quite quick enough,
and Philip lightly kissed the top of her little
pink ear, before she could elude him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; she cried, and her eyes
flashed with indignation.
</p>
<p>But Philip stood calmly smiling at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s entirely permissible,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when
any Prince finds a Sleeping Beauty, to kiss her
awake.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t asleep!&#8221; stormed Patty, &#8220;and
you knew it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave such a successful imitation of it,
that I consider myself justified,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;And, anyway, it was only a little bit of a butterfly
kiss, and it doesn&#8217;t really count.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Patty, rather relieved, &#8220;it
doesn&#8217;t count.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it counts that I have found you,&#8221; went
on Philip. &#8220;You know the rest of the story,
after the Prince kissed the Sleeping Beauty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She had to go to the Country Club ball with
him,&#8221; said Patty, laughing, as she danced away
from him. &#8220;Be careful, Philip; we&#8217;ll wake
baby May. Come on downstairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found her,&#8221; announced Philip, somewhat
unnecessarily; &#8220;and I was a blooming idiot not
to know she was there all the time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure were!&#8221; said Roger, when he heard
the story. &#8220;Did you get a good rest, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; only it was interrupted so soon,&#8221; and
Patty returned Philip&#8217;s meaning glance with a
saucy smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Roger went on, &#8220;now you two will
have to go to the masquerade together. I suppose
you&#8217;ll go as Jack and Jill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Philip, &#8220;I think fairy tales are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
much prettier than Mother Goose rhymes.
We&#8217;re going as the Sleeping Beauty in the
Wood, and the Fairy Prince. Only, of course,
the Sleeping Beauty will be awake for the occasion.
Shall I bring up your costume when I
return next week, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might like to have a voice in deciding on
the part I shall take,&#8221; said Patty, with a show
of spirit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you <i>did</i> decide it! I never should have
thought of appearing as &#8216;Prince Charming,&#8217;
if you hadn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, Philip!&#8221; said Patty, turning
very pink.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Phil!&#8221; cried Roger. &#8220;If she hadn&#8217;t
what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If she hadn&#8217;t said I&#8217;d look so sweet in a light
blue satin coat,&#8221; replied Philip, pretending to
look confused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw! She didn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; declared
Roger. &#8220;And beside, you won&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Those
court suits are lovely,&mdash;all silver lace and cocked
hats! Oh, Philip, do wear one of those! And
I&#8217;ll write to Nan, to get me a costume. What
are you going to wear, Mona?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we mustn&#8217;t tell!&#8221; said Adèle, in dismay.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
&#8220;This is a masquerade, not merely a fancy
dress ball.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to
change our plans, Philip. The Sleeping Beauty
game is all off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for the moment!&#8221; And Philip threw
her a challenging glance.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A PROPOSAL</h3>
</div>

<p>It was after midnight when the Christmas
guests went away, and Patty declared
her intention of going to bed at
once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I coasted and danced and played hide and
seek till I&#8217;m utterly worn out,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
I think I shall sleep for a week!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m going away to-morrow,&#8221; said Philip,
detaining her a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re coming back next week. I&#8217;ll
promise to be awake by then. But now I&#8217;m
going to hibernate, like a bear! Good-night,
everybody!&#8221; and Patty ran upstairs without
further ceremony.
</p>
<p>But as, in her pretty blue négligée, she sat before
the mirror brushing her long hair, Mona,
Daisy, and Adèle all came into her room, quite
evidently with a determination to chat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an old sleepy-head, Patty,&#8221; declared
Adèle. &#8220;You may sleep as late as you like in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the morning, but we want to have a little confab
now, about lots of things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicht, nein, non, no!&#8221; cried Patty, jumping
up and brandishing her hair-brush. &#8220;I know
perfectly well what your confabs mean,&mdash;an
hour or more of chattering and giggling!
Come in the morning,&mdash;I&#8217;m going to have my
chocolate upstairs to-morrow,&mdash;and I&#8217;ll give you
all the information you want. But as for to-night,
skip, scoot, scamper, and vamoose, every
dear, sweet, pretty little one of you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Laughingly, Patty pushed the three out of her
room, and closing the door after them, turned
its key, unheeding their protests, and returned
to her hair-brushing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Patricia,&#8221; she said, talking to
herself in the mirror, as she often did, &#8220;letting
those girls keep you up till all hours! You
need your beauty sleep, to preserve what small
pretence to good looks you have left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was not really vain of her pretty face,
but she well knew that her delicate type of
beauty could not stand continuous late hours
without showing it, and Patty was not mistaken
when she claimed for herself a good share of
common sense.
</p>
<p>But as she brushed away at the golden tangle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
of curls, she heard a light tap at her door, which
sounded insistent, rather than mischievous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; she asked, as she rose and went
toward the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Daisy,&#8221; said a low voice. &#8220;Let me in,
Patty, just for a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty opened the door, and Daisy Dow
came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you something,&#8221; she said, as
Patty stood waiting, brush in hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really want to tell you a bit,&mdash;but Jim says I
must,&#8221; and Daisy looked decidedly cross and
ill-tempered.
</p>
<p>Patty realised that it was a bother of some
kind, and she said, gently, &#8220;Leave it till morning,
Daisy; we&#8217;ll both feel brighter then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Jim said I must tell you to-night. Oh,
pshaw, it&#8217;s nothing, anyway! Only there <i>was</i>
a letter for you from Bill Farnsworth, and I
took it from May, and kept it for a while, just
to tease you. I was going to give it to you to-morrow,
anyway; but Jim came and asked me
about it, and made <i>such</i> a fuss! Men are so
<i>silly</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, Daisy, it isn&#8217;t anything much; only
you know people <i>do</i> like to have letters that
belong to them! But, as you say, it&#8217;s nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to make a fuss about. Incidentally, I believe
it&#8217;s a State&#8217;s prison offence,&mdash;or would be if you
opened it. You didn&#8217;t, did you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; said Daisy; &#8220;but I knew
it was only a card, like ours, and I just kept it
back for fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to me an awfully good joke,&mdash;but
never mind that. Give me the letter, and
we&#8217;ll call it square, and I won&#8217;t have you arrested
or anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty spoke lightly, but really she was deeply
annoyed at this foolish trick of Daisy&#8217;s. However,
since Jim had found out the truth and
made Daisy own up, there was no great harm
done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got the letter,&#8221; said Daisy. &#8220;I
left it downstairs, but we can get it in the morning.
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s only a card; it is just the
same size and shape as ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Daisy, what did you do it for?&#8221; And
Patty looked the girl in the eyes, in a real curiosity
to know why she should descend to this
petty meanness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re such a favourite,&#8221; said Daisy,
truthfully. &#8220;Everybody likes you best, and
everybody does everything for you, and you get
everything, and I wanted to tease you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>Patty grasped the girl by her shoulders, and
shook her good-naturedly, while she laughed
aloud. &#8220;Daisy, you <i>do</i> beat the dickens!
You know that foolish little temper of yours
is too silly for anything, and if you&#8217;d conquer
it you&#8217;d be a whole lot nicer girl! You&#8217;re just
as pretty as anybody else, and just as jolly and
attractive, but you get a notion that you&#8217;re
slighted when you&#8217;re <i>not</i>; and that makes you
ill-tempered and you lose half your charm.
Don&#8217;t you know that if you want people to love
you and admire you, you must be sunshiny and
pleasant?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, that isn&#8217;t my nature, I s&#8217;pose. I can&#8217;t
help my quick temper. But, anyway, Patty,
you&#8217;re a dear not to get mad,&mdash;and I&#8217;ll give you
the letter the first thing in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it, Daisy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I just stuck it between two volumes of
a cyclopædia, on a shelf in the library. So,
you see, we can&#8217;t get it till morning; but it will
be safe there, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying,&#8221; and Patty smiled, as
Daisy said a somewhat abrupt good-night, and
went away.
</p>
<p>There were still a few embers of a wood fire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
glowing on the hearth, and Patty sat down before
it in a big arm-chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she said to
herself, her weariness all gone now. &#8220;But I
did feel neglected to have Little Billee send the
other girls cards, and leave me out. I&#8217;d like to
see it; I hardly glanced at theirs,&mdash;though I remember,
they weren&#8217;t very pretty. I&#8217;d like to
see Little Billee again, but I don&#8217;t suppose I
ever shall. Well, there are plenty of other nice
boys in the world, so it doesn&#8217;t matter much.
All the same, I&#8217;d like to see that card. I believe
I&#8217;ll go down and get it. There&#8217;s always
a low light in the hall, and I can feel it between
the books.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hesitated for some time, but finally her
impatience or curiosity got the better of her,
and she softly opened her door and peeped out.
There were low lights in the halls, and as she
listened over the banister and heard no sounds,
Patty began to creep softly down the stairs.
Her trailing robe of light blue crêpe de chine
was edged with swansdown, and she drew it
about her, as she noiselessly tiptoed along in
her slippered feet.
</p>
<p>The hall light shone dimly into the library,
through which Patty could see a brighter light in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
the smoking-room beyond. She listened a moment,
but hearing no voices, concluded she could
creep into the library, capture her card, and return
undiscovered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, anyway,&#8221; she thought to herself,
&#8220;there can&#8217;t be anybody in the smoking-room,
or I would hear them talking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was easy to proceed without a sound by stepping
softly along the thick rugs, and as Patty
knew exactly where the cyclopædias were
shelved, she made straight for that bookcase.
It was next to the smoking-room doorway, and
as Patty reached it, she peeped around the portière
to make sure that the next room was unoccupied.
</p>
<p>But to her surprise, she saw Philip Van Reypen
stretched out in a big arm-chair in front of the
fire. His eyes were closed, but Patty saw he
was not asleep, as he was slowly smoking a
cigar. Patty saw him sidewise, and she stood
for a second contemplating the handsome profile
and the fine physique of the man, who looked
especially graceful in his careless and unconscious
position.
</p>
<p>Almost holding her breath, lest he should hear
her, Patty moved noiselessly to the shelves, being
then out of sight behind a portière.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>By slow, careful movements, it was easy
enough to move the books silently, and at last
she discovered the blue envelope, tucked between
two of them. She drew it out without
a sound,&mdash;careful lest the paper should crackle,&mdash;and
started to retrace her stealthy steps upstairs
again, when she saw the hem of the portière
move the veriest trifle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A mouse!&#8221; she thought to herself, with a
terrified spasm of fear, for Patty was foolishly
afraid of mice.
</p>
<p>Unable to control herself, she sprang up into
a soft easy-chair and perched on the back of it.
</p>
<p>The springs of the chair gave a tiny squeak,
scarcely as loud as a mouse might make, yet sufficient
to arouse Van Reypen from his reverie.
</p>
<p>He sprang up, and pushing aside the portière,
switched on the light, to see Patty sitting on the
low, tufted back of the chair, her hair streaming
about her shoulders, and her face expressing
the utmost fear and horror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he observed, looking at her with
a smile,&mdash;&#8220;<i>well</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Philip,&#8221; whispered Patty, in a quaking
voice, &#8220;it&#8217;s a mouse! an <i>awful</i> mouse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what are you going to do about it?&#8221;
and Philip folded his arms, and stood gazing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
at the pretty, frightened figure on the chair
back.
</p>
<p>His amused calm quieted Patty&#8217;s nerves, which
had really been put on edge by her uncontrollable
aversion to mice, and she returned, cheerfully,
&#8220;I suppose I shall have to stay up here
the rest of my life, unless you can attack and
vanquish the fearsome brute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not even try,&#8221; said Philip, coolly, as
he turned to throw away his cigar, &#8220;because I
like to see you sitting up there. However, as
there may be danger of another attack from the
enemy, and as this chair is almost entirely unoccupied,
I shall camp out here at your feet, and
keep guard over your safety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seated himself on the arm of the same
chair, while Patty sat on its low, cushioned back.
She drew her blue gown more closely about her,
and cast wary glances toward the corner, where
the enemy was presumably encamped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think perhaps the danger is over,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And if you&#8217;ll go back to the smoking-room,
I will make a brave effort to get away
unharmed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch me go,&#8221; said Philip, showing no signs
of moving. &#8220;However, if it will set your mind
at rest, I&#8217;ll tell you that it <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> a mouse. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
don&#8217;t believe they have such things in this well-regulated
household.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>saw</i> it!&#8221; declared Patty, positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw a mouse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not <i>exactly</i> that, but I saw that little
tassel on the portière wiggle, so it <i>must</i> have
been a mouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you are the most ridiculous little goose
on the face of this earth! Your imagination
is something marvellous! Now I&#8217;ll inform you
that the reason that tassel moved, was because
I threw a match at it. I aimed for a waste-basket
and hit the curtain, but I had no idea
that I should find myself so surprised at the
result!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty dimpled and giggled. &#8220;It <i>is</i> surprising,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said, feeling much more light-hearted
since her fears were relieved regarding
the mouse. &#8220;And I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s altogether
correct, that you and I should be down here
alone after midnight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddlestrings!&#8221; exclaimed Philip. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be a silly! And besides, Jim is about somewhere,
and Adèle has been bobbing in and out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no one in the halls when I came
down. And I think, Philip, I&#8217;d better go
back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did you come down for, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some unexplained reason, Patty suddenly
felt unwilling to tell what she had come for.
Bill&#8217;s letter was hidden in the folds of her
voluminous blue gown, and she couldn&#8217;t quite
bring herself to tell Philip that she came down
for that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was wakeful,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I came
down to get a&mdash;a book.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m; and you thought you&#8217;d take a volume
of the Britannica back with you, to read yourself
to sleep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty had to laugh at this, for in the corner
where they were, the shelves contained nothing
but cyclopædias and dictionaries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re really very interesting reading,&#8221;
she declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is the little girl who was so sleepy
she had to run off to bed as soon as the party
was over! Patty, Patty, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re not
telling me the truth! Try again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&mdash;well, then, I came down because,&mdash;because
I was hungry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s better. Anybody has a right to
be hungry, or even afraid of mice,&mdash;but no
one has a right to lug a whole cyclopædia upstairs
to read oneself to sleep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to take <i>all</i> the volumes,&#8221; said
Patty, demurely, and then she jumped down
from her perch. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just see which one I do
want,&#8221; and pretending to read the labels, she
deftly slipped her letter back between the volumes,
unseen by Van Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You little goose, you,&#8221; said Philip, laughing.
&#8220;Stop your nonsense, and let&#8217;s go and forage in
the dining-room for something to eat. We
might as well have some good food while we&#8217;re
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not exactly in proper dinner garb,&#8221;
said Patty, shaking out her blue folds, and trailing
her long robe behind her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I don&#8217;t know much about millinery,
but you never wore anything more becoming
than all that fiddly-faddly conglomeration
of blue silk and white fur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fur,&mdash;it&#8217;s down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I said you were a goose,&mdash;so it&#8217;s most
appropriate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s swansdown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be a swan, then! Be anything you
like. But come on, let&#8217;s make for the dining-room.
We&#8217;ll probably find Jim there, but don&#8217;t
make any noise, or everybody upstairs will
think we&#8217;re burglars and shoot us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Philip switched off the library light, and taking
Patty&#8217;s hand, led her through the dim hall
and into the dining-room. At the end of this
room was a wide bay window, which let in a
perfect flood of moonlight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; exclaimed Patty, &#8220;what a picture!
From my room you couldn&#8217;t tell it was moonlight
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The picture from the window was a far sweep
of hills, white with snow, and glistening in the
moonlight. In the foreground, evergreen
trees, laden with snow, stood about like sentinels,&mdash;and
a big, yellow three-quarter moon was
nearing the western horizon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it wonderful, Philip?&#8221; whispered
Patty, almost awed at the sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; he said, still holding her hand
in both his own. &#8220;Patty, you have a wonderful
appreciation of the beautiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody could help loving such a sight as
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And nobody could help loving such a girl
as you!&#8221; exclaimed Philip, drawing her into
his arms. &#8220;Patty, darling, you know I love
you! Patty, <i>do</i> care for me a <i>little</i> bit, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Philip,&#8221; and Patty drew gently away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
from him. &#8220;<i>Please</i> don&#8217;t talk to me like that!
Oh, I oughtn&#8217;t to be here! Let me go, Philip,&mdash;I
<i>know</i> this isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> right, Patty, darling; because I love you,
and I want you for all my own. Say you love
me, and that will make <i>everything</i> all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t, Philip.&#8221; And Patty&#8217;s voice carried
a hint of tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will, dear; you <i>must</i>, because I love
you <i>so</i>. Patty, I have always loved you, I
think, since I first saw you on the stairs at Aunty
Van&#8217;s that evening. Do you remember?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember; but please, Philip, let me
go now, and <i>don&#8217;t</i> talk to me this way. I don&#8217;t
<i>want</i> you to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re frightened, Patty, that&#8217;s all; and perhaps
I ought not to have spoken just now; but
you looked so sweet, in the moonlight, with that
wonderful hair of yours curling about your
shoulders, that I just couldn&#8217;t help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll forgive you, Philip, if you&#8217;ll forget this
whole occurrence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it? Why, Patty, what do you mean?
I never forget it for a single moment! I was
sitting there to-night, dreaming of <i>you</i>. I
wasn&#8217;t asleep, you know, I was just thinking
about you, and wondering how soon I might tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
you my thoughts. You&#8217;re so young, dear,&mdash;I&#8217;m
half a dozen years older than you are,&mdash;but I
want you, my little Patty. Mayn&#8217;t I hope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right, Philip. I <i>am</i> too young
to think of such things. So cut it out for a
couple of years, and then I&#8217;ll see about it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you rogue, how <i>can</i> you speak like
that? Don&#8217;t you love me a least little bit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a teenty weenty speck! And if you
don&#8217;t give me something to eat, I won&#8217;t even
<i>like</i> you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s a bargain, then,&mdash;if I find something
nice for you to eat, will you like me a
whole lot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do like you a whole lot, anyway; but I don&#8217;t
love you and I&#8217;m not going to love <i>anybody</i>,
<i>ever</i>! I do think being grown-up is a regular
nuisance, and I wish I was a little girl again,
with my hair down my back!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Incidentally, your hair <i>is</i> down your back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; and Patty shook her
curly mane. &#8220;I wear it that way in tableaux
and things, so what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There <i>isn&#8217;t</i> any difference. We&#8217;ll pretend
you&#8217;re a tableau.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll be Patience on a Monument,
waiting for some supper.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was Little Tommy Tucker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; <i>he</i> sang for his supper. I&#8217;m not going
to sing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, <i>don&#8217;t</i>! Your top notes
would bring the whole crowd down here!
Patty, if you&#8217;ll promise to love me <i>some time</i>,
I&#8217;ll stop teasing you <i>now</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Philip, I&#8217;d do &#8217;most anything to have
you stop teasing me now! But how <i>can</i> I tell
who I&#8217;m going to love when I get old enough
to love anybody?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t love anybody yet, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do <i>not</i>!&#8221; and Patty shook her head with
great emphasis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have a fair show, anyway.&#8221; And
Philip drew the curtain that shut out the moonlight,
and switched on the electric light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exit Romance!&#8221; he said, &#8220;and enter Comedy!
Now, Patty, you&#8217;re my little playmate;
we&#8217;re just two kiddies in the pantry, stealing
jam,&mdash;that is, if we can find any jam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The pantry&#8217;s the place,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;there&#8217;s
nothing in the sideboard but biscuit and raisins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t sound very good to me. To
the pantry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Into the pantries they went, and there, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
cupboards and iceboxes, found all sorts of good
things.
</p>
<p>Cold turkey, game pâté, jellies, custards, cakes,
and all varieties of food.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is ever so much more fun than moonlight,&#8221;
said Patty, as she perched herself on a
table, there being no chair, and held a partridge
wing in one hand and a macaroon in the other.
&#8220;Could you find me a glass of milk, Philip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; anything you want, my
Princess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you said Jim was about,&#8221; Patty
remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; returned Philip, calmly. &#8220;I saw
him go upstairs as we came in the dining-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he see us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! He grinned at me and I grinned at
him. I didn&#8217;t invite him to come with us,&mdash;so
being a polite gentleman, he didn&#8217;t come. He
doesn&#8217;t mind our eating up his food. He&#8217;s
awful hospitable, Jim is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had enough of his food, and now
I&#8217;m going back to my downy couch. If I don&#8217;t
see you to-morrow before you leave,&mdash;good-bye,
Philip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice, casual way to say good-bye to
a man who has just proposed to you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! <i>Was</i> that a proposal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, rather! What did you think it was?
A sermon, or just a bit of oratory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Philip, truly I didn&#8217;t realise
it at the time,&#8221; and Patty&#8217;s smile was very provoking,
as she looked up into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would your answer have been different if
you had?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not that! But I just want you to
understand that I don&#8217;t consider it a real proposal,&#8221;
and Patty laughed and ran away, leaving
Philip to &#8220;clear up&#8221; the pantry.
</p>
<p>She stopped a moment in the library, long
enough to get her blue letter, and then scuttled
up the stairs and into her own room.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A CHRISTMAS CARD</h3>
</div>

<p>Once safely behind her locked door,
Patty tore open her blue envelope.
It was only a card,&mdash;but not an ordinary
printed Christmas card.
</p>
<p>In the upper corner was a spray of apple blossoms,
exquisitely painted; and on the card were
some verses, written in a hand that was small
and fine, but unmistakably the same as the address
on the outside of the envelope.
</p>
<p>With a little sigh of pleasure, Patty cuddled
up in her arm-chair to read the Christmas message.
</p>
<p>But it proved to be not very Christmassy, after
all; for this is what she read:
</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;MY LADY OF DELIGHT</p>
</div>

<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;My Lady of Delight&#8217;s a dainty, winsome thing;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Her lovely, smiling lips are roses set to rhyme,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>She has a merry, lilting laugh, like Bluebells all a-chime.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>The radiance of her smile, the sunshine in her eyes,</p>

<p>Patty read the verses over twice, with shining
eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he wrote them himself,&#8221; she
mused. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he did; he must have
copied them. He knows an awful lot of pretty
poetry like that. And yet it doesn&#8217;t sound like
a real poet&#8217;s poetry, either. And he used to
call me Apple Blossom,&mdash;such a pretty name.
Philip would never think of such a thing as that.
I wonder if I like Little Billee better than I do
Philip. I wonder if he likes me better. But
of course he can&#8217;t, or he would have written
to me in all this time. I haven&#8217;t seen him since
August, and he never wrote a word, except the
stiffest kind of a line with those flowers he sent
me. I thought he&#8217;d forgotten all about me!
But I can&#8217;t think so now,&mdash;unless he just came
across this poem, and it recalled me to his mind.
Well, I came awfully near not getting it! I
don&#8217;t see how Daisy <i>could</i> have been so mean;
I don&#8217;t like that kind of a joke a bit. But of
course she thought it was just a printed card,
like hers and Mona&#8217;s. Well, she&#8217;ll never know
it <i>isn&#8217;t</i>,&mdash;that&#8217;s one thing sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Patty tucked her card of verses under
her pillow and went to sleep.
</p>
<p>The next morning, as Patty had prophesied,
she slept late. Daisy peeped into her room two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
or three times before she finally found Patty&#8217;s
blue eyes open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; she said, sitting down on the edge
of the bed. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d never wake up!
Patty, what do you think? I&#8217;ve been down
in the library, and I can&#8217;t find that card! I&#8217;m
awfully sorry, truly I am; I&#8217;ll give you mine if
you want it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Daisy,&#8221; and Patty smiled at the
recollection of Mona&#8217;s similar offer. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s
cards seem to be a drug in the market! But you
may keep yours, and also set your mind at rest
about mine; for I sneaked downstairs last night
in the dark, and fished it out for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did! Oh, Patty, weren&#8217;t you frightened
to prowl around like that, late at night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty shook with laughter. &#8220;I <i>was</i> frightened,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;when I thought I saw a
mouse,&mdash;but it wasn&#8217;t a mouse, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid of a mouse! But
you might have met a,&mdash;a burglar or something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and Patty still grinned. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
meet any <i>burglar</i>. But I got the card, Daisy,
so that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it like mine? Let me see it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t exactly like yours, and I won&#8217;t let
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
you see it. You kept it away from me, and
now it&#8217;s my turn to keep it away from you.
And by the way, Daisy, that was a mean thing
to do, and I don&#8217;t want you to do anything like
that to me again!&#8221; Patty&#8217;s sweet face showed
an unusually stern expression, and her blue eyes
looked straight into Daisy&#8217;s as she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, Patty; truly, I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m awfully
sorry, but I did it on a sudden impulse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it; and, Daisy, I want you to try not
to give way to those &#8216;sudden impulses&#8217; when
they&#8217;re mean ones. You have enough good,
generous impulses to keep you busy. Now, you
mustn&#8217;t mind if your Aunt Patty lectures you
a little bit, because as the teachers always say,
&#8216;it&#8217;s for your own good.&#8217; And if you&#8217;ll please
take a chair, instead of sitting all over my feet,
I&#8217;d like to have my breakfast; for I hear my
pretty little Swedish Hedwig bringing it in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The smiling maid appeared with Patty&#8217;s breakfast
tray, followed by Mona and Adèle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Company already!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, sitting
up in bed. &#8220;Hedwig, quick, my breakfast cap,&mdash;the
pink one,&mdash;and the nightingale to match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The maid threw the silken wrap around Patty&#8217;s
shoulders, and tucked her hair into the
lace-frilled cap, which was of a Dutch shape,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
and made Patty look like the pictures of Holland&#8217;s
pretty queen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem hungry,&#8221; said Mona, as
Patty toyed with her chocolate. &#8220;Now, I ate
a most astonishing breakfast, because I forgot
to eat my supper last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; returned Patty, dropping
her lashes to hide her twinkling eyes, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
forget to eat my supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The recollection of that supper in the pantry
was too much for her, and she burst into laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter with you, Patty?&#8221; said
Adèle. &#8220;You&#8217;re acting like a harmless lunatic!
However, I&#8217;m sent to tell you to hop up and get
dressed, for one of your admirers below stairs
wants you to go for a sleighride with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim?&#8221; asked Patty, looking up with a
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Mr. Van Reypen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good gracious! I don&#8217;t care about going
riding with Philip; I can see <i>him</i> in New
York. I hoped it was Hal,&mdash;that&#8217;s why I said
Jim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; said her hostess, &#8220;you&#8217;re a born
coquette, and always will be! But your wiles
are wasted on me. Save them for your suitors.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
But, truly, Mr. Van Reypen is going on an
errand for me, and he said that he wanted to
show you <i>some</i> little attention while he was
here, and he guessed he&#8217;d let you go along with
him in the cutter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a cutter ride,&#8221; and Patty began to scramble
out of bed. &#8220;That sounds rather good
fun. But I&#8217;d rather go with Hal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re candid, at any rate,&#8221; said Daisy.
&#8220;But as it happens, Hal and I are going to
practise some music this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, in that case, I&#8217;ve nothing more to say.&#8221;
And Patty smiled good-naturedly at Daisy.
&#8220;And I suppose Mona and Roger are going
somewhere to play by themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort,&#8221; said Mona. &#8220;Roger&#8217;s
going back to the city this morning, and I&#8217;m
going to write letters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought Philip was going back to the
city,&#8221; said Patty, looking at Adèle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going on the afternoon train. Go on
and get dressed, Patty, and don&#8217;t waste any
more time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and Patty made an expeditious
toilette and in little more than half an hour
went downstairs equipped for her ride.
</p>
<p>She was enveloped from head to foot in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
raccoon fur coat, with a jaunty hat of the same,
trimmed only with a bright quill feather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do we go?&#8221; she demanded, presenting
herself before Philip, who was waiting in the
hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To get butter and eggs,&#8221; he returned,
gravely. &#8220;The Kenerley larder is entirely
empty of those two very necessary ingredients.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do <i>we</i> go for them? Are there no
servants to send?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girls shouldn&#8217;t ask questions,&#8221; and
without further ceremony Philip tucked her into
the waiting sleigh, sprang in beside her, and
took up the lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, this is great!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, as the
pair of fine horses went dashing down the drive,
and the clear, keen winter air blew against her
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I thought the sleighride would brace
you up. And, really, there seemed to be nobody
to send on this errand, so I said we&#8217;d
go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it far?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; only about five miles; we&#8217;ll be back for
luncheon. How did you sleep, after your late
supper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and Patty smiled back into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Philip&#8217;s face. &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t hungry for my
breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not! You ate enough last
night for two little girls like you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t two little girls like me!&#8221; said
Patty, with twinkling eyes, and Philip exclaimed:
&#8220;Indeed, there aren&#8217;t! I say, Patty, my Princess
Patty, <i>do</i> be engaged to me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you ridiculous boy, I won&#8217;t! And if
you say another word on the subject, I&#8217;ll be real
downright mad at you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I won&#8217;t. Now, see here, Princess,
do you mean to go to this masquerade ball
with me? For, if not, I&#8217;m not coming back
here for New Year&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, I&#8217;m going with you. Who
else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. But there would
be plenty glad to take you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! I know that. But I want to go
with you. What shall we wear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of some foolish thing, like
Little Bo-Peep, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to be that! A shepherdess
costume, and a crook with ribbons on. But I
want you to wear a satin coat and knee-breeches.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be Old King Cole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t like that. I&#8217;ll tell you! You
be Little Boy Blue.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Gainsborough picture?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that won&#8217;t do either. Oh, you be
Bobby Shafto! He wears &#8216;silver buckles on
his knee,&#8217; don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>do</i> know! And what&#8217;s the next
line?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Patty, turning pink. &#8220;I
want you to wear a real Bobby Shafto costume.
So you will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if my Princess commands. I&#8217;ll
have it made at once. Can I help about
yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you might go to see Nan, and tell her
what I want, and she&#8217;ll get it and send it up
here. A shepherdess rig is easy enough, and
there&#8217;s nothing prettier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be lovely. I say, which way do we
turn here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To go to Hatton&#8217;s Corners? Oh, to the
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t. I remember distinctly, Jim said,
be sure to take the right road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He meant right, not wrong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! he didn&#8217;t. He meant right, not
left. Turn right, Philip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They turned right, into a wide, straight road.
The sleighing was fine, though not yet sufficiently
packed. But, with the light cutter, and
two good horses, they spun along in great shape.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about sleighing that&#8217;s different
from anything else,&#8221; remarked Patty,
with the air of one expounding a great truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the exhilaration. Spinning along like
this, with the snow crunching under us, beats
motoring, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; for an occasional ride. But for all
the year round, motoring is best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Sleighing isn&#8217;t much fun in July
or August.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! don&#8217;t be silly. But, I say, Philip,
where are we? Jim said we&#8217;d pass Little Falls,
and then we must follow the trolley line all the
way to the butter and egg house. I don&#8217;t see
any trolley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I, yet. But we&#8217;ll soon strike it.
Ah, here we are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; this is a railroad,&mdash;a steam railroad, I
mean. Philip, we&#8217;re off the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are. I&#8217;m sorry I insisted on turning
to the right at that corner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>didn&#8217;t</i> insist. <i>I</i> did! But I thought it
was right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> right, dear. Anything is right, where
you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stop talking foolishness, and
find the right road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you call that <i>foolishness</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do! I&#8217;d rather you&#8217;d get to the egg
house and back before it begins to storm. And
by the looks of the sky, I&#8217;m sure it <i>is</i> going to
storm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! nothing like that. But I say!
Princess! it&#8217;s after one o&#8217;clock! Now, who
would have thought it? And they expect us
back to luncheon!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After one! Oh, Philip, it <i>can&#8217;t</i> be!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is! Well, Patty Pink, the best thing
to do, <i>I</i> think, is to go to that house I see in
the dim distance, and ask our way. The last
two or three signposts have shown names <i>I</i>
never heard of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I either,&#8221; said Patty, in a meek voice. &#8220;I
noticed them, but I didn&#8217;t say anything, because
it&#8217;s my fault we went astray.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind. We&#8217;re in for a lark,
that&#8217;s all. &#8216;Afar in the desert I love to ride&#8217;&mdash;what
comes next, Patty?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;With the silent Bushboy alone by my
side&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it; but thank goodness, you&#8217;re not
silent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor a Bushboy, either. But I don&#8217;t like
this, Philip. We&#8217;re&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re far frae our hame, and all that. But
don&#8217;t you worry, my Princess. You&#8217;re with me,
and so you&#8217;re not lost. You know, it&#8217;s better
to be loved than lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Philip, stop talking about love! It&#8217;s
bad enough to be lost,&mdash;and we <i>are</i> lost,&mdash;without
having somebody harping about love all the
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t much of a time or place, is
it? So, suppose we invade this peaceful
dwelling, and inquire our latitude and longitude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove up a winding road to a large, old-fashioned
house, and Philip jumped out at the
front door.
</p>
<p>His summons on the big, brass knocker was
answered by a prim little lady, with grey hair
and bright, dark eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, madame,&#8221; said Philip, in his best
manner. &#8220;We have lost our way. Will you
tell me how to reach Hatton&#8217;s Corners?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hatton&#8217;s Corners! Why, that&#8217;s a good ten
miles from here. Where&#8217;d you come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;From Fern Falls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you took the wrong road at the Big
Tree Fork. You&#8217;d oughter &#8216;a&#8217; gone to the
left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m; you may be right. But must we go
back there, or is there a shorter cut?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there ain&#8217;t no shorter cut. But your
young lady looks cold. Won&#8217;t you two come
in and take a bite o&#8217; dinner, and get warm before
you go on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is true hospitality, madame.
What do you say, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked uncertain. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
to say,&#8221; she replied, hesitatingly. &#8220;I <i>am</i> cold;
but I&#8217;m afraid it would delay us so long that
Adèle will worry about us. I think we&#8217;d better
jog along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But then another old lady appeared. She was
rounder, rosier, plumper, and jollier than the
first, and she cried out, heartily: &#8220;Jog along?
Well, I reckon not! I jest waited to slip into
my shoes,&mdash;my feet&#8217;s awful tender,&mdash;and then I
come right out here to see what&#8217;s goin&#8217; on.
Now, you two young folks come right in, and
set a spell. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t often we get a chance to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
have comp&#8217;ny,&mdash;and on chicken pie day,
too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew, chicken pie!&#8221; exclaimed Philip.
&#8220;How about it, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a telephone?&#8221; asked Patty, with
a sudden inspiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, miss. Now you jest come along.
&#8217;Kiah, the hired man, he&#8217;ll look after your
horses, and I&#8217;m free to confess they need a rest
and a feed, even if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;We must have
come twelve or fifteen miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all o&#8217; that from Fern Falls. My, I&#8217;m
right down glad to look after you two. You
do seem to need it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The speaker&#8217;s twinkling dark eyes looked at
her two visitors with such comprehension that
Patty blushed and Philip smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re from Mr. Kenerley&#8217;s house,&#8221; he explained,&mdash;&#8220;guests
there, you know. And we
started for Hatton&#8217;s Corners to get some butter
and eggs&mdash;and somehow, we took the wrong
turn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all my fault,&#8221; confessed Patty. &#8220;I
insisted on coming this way, though Mr. Van
Reypen thought the other was right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, never mind! It&#8217;ll jest be a nice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
smart trip back after dinner. I&#8217;m Mrs. Fay,
and this is my sister, Miss Wilhelmina Winthrop.
She&#8217;s got a longer name than I have,
but I&#8217;ve got a longer head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were ushered into the old-fashioned sitting-room,
with its Brussels carpet showing huge
baskets of flowers; its heterogeneous furniture,
some chairs haircloth and black walnut, and
others cane-seated, with rep cushions tied on;
marble tables, of course; and an old sofa, with
well-worn pillows and rugs.
</p>
<p>But the place had a hospitable air, and the two
hostesses were fairly beaming with delight at
this opportunity for entertainment. Miss Winthrop
carried Patty off to her own bedroom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jest all tuckered out, I can see,&#8221; she
said, hovering around her like a clucking hen;
&#8220;but a wash-up and a good dish o&#8217; chicken pie
will put you all to rights again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must telephone before we eat dinner,&#8221;
said Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you shall,&mdash;so you shall. Now, don&#8217;t
you worry the leastest mite about anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How kind you are!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, smiling
on the happy little old lady. &#8220;I suppose
you belong to the real old New England Winthrops?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we&#8217;re mighty proud of our name.
I was so much so that I never would change
it,&#8221;&mdash;and she chuckled. &#8220;Sister, though, she
thought Fay was prettier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fay <i>is</i> pretty,&#8221; said Patty, cordially, &#8220;and
now, if I may, I&#8217;ll telephone, for I know our
people will be wondering where we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Miss Fairfield; come right along.&#8221;
But in returning to the sitting-room, Patty
found Philip was already at the telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;lost our way; took
wrong turning at Big Tree Fork. Brought up,
somehow, at Mrs. Fay&#8217;s. Accepted invitation
to dinner,&mdash;chicken pie!&mdash;Start back immediately
after the E in Pie! See? Expect us
when we get there. Will accumulate a butter
and a egg or two, on our way home. Love
to all. Philip.&#8221; He concluded his harangue,
and turned to Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All serene on the Potomac, Patty Pink! I
told them all it was necessary for them to know;
and if they desire further information, they can
call us up. They know where we are. Me for
the chicken pie!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>STORMBOUND</h3>
</div>

<p>The two old ladies were not of the quaint
type, nor was their home picturesque.
The place and the people were merely
old-fashioned, and they were almost primitive in
their ways. They were kind-hearted and hospitable,
but they were of the rugged New England
class that has lost the charm of its Colonial
ancestry.
</p>
<p>The dinner was wholesome and plentiful, but
with no variety, and served in the plainest fashion.
The chicken pie was delicious, but it had
no accompaniments except home-made hot
biscuit and coffee with thick, rich, country
cream.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I always say,&#8221; said Miss Winthrop, as she
settled herself at the table, &#8220;that chicken pie is
a whole meal in itself, without any bothersome
side-dishes. I say it&#8217;s meat and drink both;
but sister says she just can&#8217;t enjoy it &#8217;thout she
has a cup of coffee alongside of it. Well, I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
no objections to the coffee, I&#8217;m sure, but I&#8217;m
free to admit it does seem superfluous. Still,
with company so, it ain&#8217;t so much out of
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if we&#8217;ve made you any extra trouble,&#8221;
said Patty, giving Miss Winthrop one of
her best smiles; &#8220;but <i>I&#8217;m</i> free to confess that
this is the most wonderful coffee that I&#8217;ve ever
tasted, and I think it goes specially well with
the pie. And as for these light biscuit,
they&#8217;re just puffs of lusciousness! Aren&#8217;t they,
Philip?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, indeed! All you say is true, but
both coffee and biscuit pale beside the glory of
this chicken pie! There never <i>was</i> such another!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fay beamed with delight at these generous
compliments, and said, complacently,
&#8220;Yes, they ain&#8217;t many can make chicken pie like
mine, if I do say it. My, ain&#8217;t it lucky you
young people happened along, to-day of all
days! And land knows, I don&#8217;t want you to
go away right off. I&#8217;d like you to set a spell
after dinner. But I feel it my bounden duty to
tell you that &#8217;Kiah says there&#8217;s a storm
a-brewin&#8217;. But I don&#8217;t think you need start off
before, say, three o&#8217;clock, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Three o&#8217;clock will do nicely,&#8221; returned
Philip, gaily. &#8220;That will give us time to stop
at Hatton&#8217;s Corners and get home before dark.
Personally, I&#8217;m not in a bit of a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; And Mrs. Fay looked quizzically at
her guests. &#8220;I just reckon, young man, that
you ain&#8217;t one mite sorry that you lost your way
and had this little outing with your young
lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I&#8217;m not sorry, Mrs. Fay; and beside
our little outing, we&#8217;re having a pleasant visit
with you, and we&#8217;re enjoying every minute
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed we are,&#8221; said Patty, glancing out of
the window as she spoke. &#8220;But it&#8217;s beginning
to snow already, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better
wait until three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land&#8217;s sake!&#8221; and Miss Winthrop turned
to look out of the window behind her. &#8220;So
it is snowing! And when it begins that way,
with fine flakes, slanting crossways, it means
business! I dunno as you can hardly dare
venture on a twelve-mile ride in the face of this.
&#8217;Pears to me it&#8217;s going to be a blizzard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Mina; you do always look on
the dark side,&#8221; expostulated her sister. &#8220;Now
<i>I</i> think &#8217;tain&#8217;t nothing but a flurry, and by then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
dinner is over, it&#8217;ll be bright sunshine again.
Now, have your plates filled up, friends, and
try and make out a meal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Fay fairly beamed with hospitality as
she urged more viands upon her guests. The
table appointments were of the plainest, being
thick white china and coarse table napery, with
plated silverware. Patty had expected thin little
old teaspoons of hall-marked silver, and old
blue or perhaps copper-lustre teacups, but this
household was not of that sort. Everything
seemed to date from the early seventies, and
Patty wondered why there were no old Winthrop
heirlooms in the family.
</p>
<p>She brought the conversation round to antiques,
and Mrs. Fay remarked, decidedly: &#8220;I
just can&#8217;t bear old-fashioned things. I come
into quite a lot of old mahogany furniture and
pewter and dishes and things when my grandfather
died. But when I got married, I had
an auction and sold everything. Then I took
the money and bought a whole new outfit. I
believe in going right along with the times.
&#8217;Course those old things were all right for
grandfather, but when I married, I&#8217;m free to
confess, I wanted things that were in style then.
So I bought a real tasty outfit, and I&#8217;ve kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
it careful, and it&#8217;s pretty near as good as new
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked around with pride at her dining-room
furnishings, which seemed to Patty about
the worst she had ever seen.
</p>
<p>But she smiled at her hostess, and said, cordially:
&#8220;I <i>do</i> think it&#8217;s nice to have just what
you want; and I think we do get attached to
our own things. Have you lived here long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land, yes! Nearly all my life. Mr. Fay,
he&#8217;s been dead twenty-five years; so sister and
me we live here together, as contented as you
please. We have a telephone and a rural delivery,
so you see it&#8217;s just the same as if we were
right in town. Now, if you really won&#8217;t eat
any more pie, let&#8217;s go into the sittin&#8217;-room a
spell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the sitting-room windows the view of
the storm seemed more serious. The sky was
black, the wind was blowing a gale, and the
snow-flurry had grown thicker. In fact, it was
a hard snowstorm, and Miss Winthrop&#8217;s fear
of a blizzard did not seem entirely unfounded.
</p>
<p>The young people took it lightly, however.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no use worrying,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;We
ought to be thankful, Philip, that we&#8217;re under
shelter, and with such kind friends. You&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
keep us till the storm is over, won&#8217;t you, Mrs.
Fay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and glad to. You just can&#8217;t think of
starting now, so you might as well settle down
and make the best of it. Want to telephone
to your people again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will after a while; but there&#8217;s no use
calling them up now. Let&#8217;s wait and see
whether the storm grows worse or better.
Why, if it&#8217;s a blizzard, we may have to stay
here all night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you none,&#8221; and Mrs.
Fay swung back and forth complacently in her
plush patent-rocker. &#8220;We got two spare bedrooms,
and I&#8217;ll just be tickled to death to put
you up over night. You&#8217;re just like a streak
of sunshine in the house, Miss Fairfield,
and I&#8217;m glad to have you as long as you&#8217;ll
stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d call me a streak of sunshine,&#8221;
said Philip. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to be called that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re bright enough,&#8221; and Mrs. Fay
looked at him, serenely. &#8220;But you&#8217;re a different
kind of a streak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A streak of lightning, I guess, if need be,&#8221;
said Miss Winthrop, nodding her head at
Philip, as if she appreciated his capabilities.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quick at some things,&#8221; said Philip, modestly.
&#8220;But, jiminy crickets! I don&#8217;t believe
we&#8217;re going to be very quick getting away from
here! Just look at the storm, <i>now</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fury of the elements had increased. The
wind was a raging northern blast, and the snow
was already piled in drifts. It was, in fact, a
blizzard in a small way, and was rapidly growing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But never mind the weather, so long as
we&#8217;re together,&#8221; sang Patty with a little trill,
as she danced about the room. Then she seated
herself at the old, square piano, and began to
sing snatches of gay songs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My land! How pretty you do sing,&#8221; said
Miss Winthrop, who was leaning on the end
of the piano, listening delightedly. &#8220;Oh, sing
more, won&#8217;t you? I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve had
such a treat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Patty sang several of her prettiest songs,
and the two old ladies were enchanted. Moreover,
Eliza, the maid-of-all-work, and &#8217;Kiah,
the hired man, appeared in the doorway of the
sitting-room and listened too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Philip; let&#8217;s give them a duet,&#8221;
and Patty broke into some rollicking college
songs, in which Philip joined.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>Glad to be able to please their kind entertainers,
they kept on singing for an hour or
more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was great!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Fay,
as Patty rose at last from the piano stool. &#8220;I
used to sing some, and he used to sing bass.
My, but we had nice times singing together
there at that same piano. You two just made
me think of it all over again. I think it&#8217;s awful
nice for two to sing together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re awfully fond of singing together,&#8221;
said Philip, with a glance at Patty,
half mischievous, half tender, whereat Patty
blushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; said Mrs. Fay, nodding
her head. &#8220;I see just how it is with you
two. You can&#8217;t hide it, you know, so you
needn&#8217;t to try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to hide anything, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221;
said Philip. But Patty said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish,
Philip; there&#8217;s nothing to hide! You&#8217;re mistaken,
Mrs. Fay, if you think we&#8217;re anything
more than friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, land, child, I know what that means!
Maybe you ain&#8217;t ready to say yes yet, but you
will soon. Well, it ain&#8217;t none of my business,
but I&#8217;m free to confess you are as proper-lookin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
a young couple as I&#8217;d want to meet; and mighty
well suited to each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; began Philip, but Patty
turned the subject and went back to the weather,
which was always a safe ground for conversation,
if not safe to go out into.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, going to the window for the
fourteenth time; &#8220;it&#8217;s perfectly hopeless to
think of starting. And it&#8217;s after four now, and
it&#8217;s blowing great guns and snowing like all possessed!
Mrs. Fay, we&#8217;ll simply have to accept
your hospitality for the night. Now I think
I&#8217;ll telephone Adèle that we&#8217;re stormbound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But though Patty called and called, she could
get no answer from the telephone Central.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess the wires must be down,&#8221; said Miss
Winthrop. &#8220;They broke down last winter
with a snow that came sudden, just like this,
and &#8217;twas a week before we got it fixed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; and Philip took the receiver
from Patty&#8217;s hand. But it made no difference
who tried, they could get no answer of any kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Philip, as he hung up the
receiver again, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter much. They
know we&#8217;re safe, and they know where we are,
and they know we couldn&#8217;t start out in a storm
like this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll come for us with a motor,&#8221;
suggested Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They might if we were nearer. But a motor
would get stalled before it could get over here
and back again in these drifts. It&#8217;s an awful
storm, Patty, and the sooner you make up your
mind that we can&#8217;t go home to-night, the better
for all concerned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind&#8217;s made up, then,&#8221; and Patty
danced about the room. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind a bit!
I think it&#8217;s a lark. Do you have feather beds,
Mrs. Fay?&mdash;I mean the kind you climb up to
with step-ladders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Land no, child! We ain&#8217;t old-fashioned
folks, you know. We have springs and mattresses
just like you do at home. Well, I&#8217;m
sorry if your folks are worried, but I&#8217;m glad
to have you young people stay the night.
Maybe this evening, you&#8217;ll sing for us some
more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;We&#8217;ll sing everything
we know, and then make up some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once having made up her mind to the inevitable,
Patty ceased bothering about it, and
proceeded to enjoy herself and to entertain
everybody else. She chatted pleasantly with
the old lady, she coquetted with Philip, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
finally wandered out into the kitchen to make
friends with Eliza.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you get supper,&#8221; she said, for, to
tell the truth, the novelty of the situation had
passed, and Patty began to feel a little bored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to get, miss,&#8221; returned
Eliza, a rawboned, countrified girl who was
shy in the presence of this city lady.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let me help you, anyway. Mayn&#8217;t I
set the table?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you wouldn&#8217;t know where the
things was. Here, take this dish and go down
cellar for the butter, if so be&#8217;s you have to
do somethin&#8217;. It&#8217;s in a kag, underneath the
swing-shelf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing-shelf?&#8221; said Patty, interested&mdash;&#8220;what
is a swing-shelf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, a shelf hanging from the ceiling, to
keep things on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why does it hang from the ceiling? I
never heard of such a thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so the rats or mice can&#8217;t get at the
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rats or mice!&#8221; and Patty gave a wild
scream. &#8220;Here, take your plate, Eliza. I
wouldn&#8217;t go down there for a million billion
dollars!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>Patty ran back to the sitting-room. &#8220;Oh,
Philip,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;they have rats and mice!
Can&#8217;t we go home? I don&#8217;t mind the
storm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, Patty,&#8221; said Philip, meeting
her half-way across the room, and taking her
hand in his. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>not</i> silly! But I <i>can&#8217;t</i> stay where they
keep rats and mice! Why, Philip, they <i>expect</i>
them. They build high shelves on purpose for
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must excuse this little girl, Mrs. Fay,&#8221;
said Philip. &#8220;She&#8217;s really sensible in most
ways, but she&#8217;s an absolute idiot about mice, and
she can&#8217;t help it. Why, the other night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty drew her hand away from Philip&#8217;s clasp,
and put it over his mouth. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; she said,
blushing furiously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you say another
word! I&#8217;m <i>not</i> afraid of mice, Mrs. Fay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, child; I know you are, and I
don&#8217;t blame you a mite. I am, too, or leastways,
I used to be. I&#8217;ve kinder got over it of
late years. But I know just how you feel.
Now, let me tell you; <i>honest</i>, never a mouse
dares show the tip of his nose outside the cellar!
If you don&#8217;t go down there, you&#8217;re as safe as
you would be up in a balloon. And I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
count none the less on you for acting skittish
about &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it, either,&#8221; said Philip, who was
still holding Patty&#8217;s hand by way of reassurance.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t mind if you acted skittisher yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Patty drew her hand away, declaring that
Mrs. Fay had quieted her fears entirely, and
that if Eliza would promise to keep the cellar
door shut, she wouldn&#8217;t give another thought
to the dreaded animals.
</p>
<p>After supper, the four played a game of old-fashioned
whist, which delighted the two old
ladies, though it seemed strange to Patty and
Philip, who were both good bridge players.
Then there was more music, and at ten o&#8217;clock
Miss Winthrop informed them that it was bedtime.
</p>
<p>With considerable pride she took Patty up
to the best spare room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I hope you&#8217;ll be comfortable,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m sure you will be. Here&#8217;s my
best night-gown for you, and a dressing-gown
and slippers. I don&#8217;t need &#8217;em,&mdash;I can get
along. And here&#8217;s a brush and comb. And
now, that&#8217;s everything you want, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty was touched at the kindliness of the old
lady, and though inwardly amused at the meagerness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
of her night appointments, she said, gratefully,
&#8220;You&#8217;re so kind to me, Miss Winthrop.
Truly, I do appreciate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sweet little thing,&#8221; returned the old
lady. &#8220;Now let me unhook you,&mdash;I should
admire to do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Miss Winthrop assisted Patty to undress,
and finally, after minute directions about the
turning down and blowing out of the kerosene
lamp, she went away.
</p>
<p>When Patty surveyed herself in the mirror,
she almost laughed aloud. The night-dress was
of thick, unbleached muslin, made with tight
bands to button around the neck and wrists.
These bands were edged with a row of narrow
tatting; and it was this trimming, Patty felt
sure, that differentiated Miss Winthrop&#8217;s best
night-gown from her others. Then Patty tried
on the dressing-gown, which was of dark grey
flannel. This, too, was severely plain, though
voluminous in shape; and the slippers were of
black felt, and quite large enough for Patty to
put both feet in one. She arrayed herself in
these things and gave way to silent laughter as
she pirouetted across the room. But her
amusement at the unattractive garments in no
way lessened her real appreciation of the gentle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
kindliness and hospitality that had been accorded
to her.
</p>
<p>At last she tucked herself into bed, and rolling
over on the nubbly mattress and creaky springs,
she almost wished that it had been a feather bed.
But she was soon asleep, and thought no more
about anything until morning.
</p>
<p>Breakfast was at half-past seven, and after
that, the long morning dragged. The fun and
novelty had worn off, and Patty was anxious to
get back to Fern Falls. She was bright and
entertaining as ever, but the spontaneous enthusiasm
of the day before had vanished.
</p>
<p>But it was impossible to start that morning,
Philip said. The roads were piled high with
drifts, and almost impassable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why can&#8217;t we break the roads?&#8221; asked
Patty. &#8220;Somebody has to do it, and I&#8217;m sure
Jim&#8217;s horses are as good as anybody&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girls mustn&#8217;t advise on matters which
they know nothing about,&#8221; said Philip, unable
to resist the temptation to tease her.
</p>
<p>Patty pouted a little, and then, with a sudden
resolution, was her own sunny self again. &#8220;All
right, Philip,&#8221; she said, smiling at him. &#8220;I
know you&#8217;ll start as soon as it&#8217;s possible. When
will that be?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can go this afternoon, dear; right
after dinner, maybe. The man thinks the
roads will be broken by that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The storm had ceased, and it was cloudy most
of the morning, but about noon the sun came
out, and by two o&#8217;clock they prepared to start.
</p>
<p>The two kind old ladies were sorry to see them
go, and begged them to come again some time
to visit them.
</p>
<p>Patty said good-bye with expressions of real
and honestly meant gratitude, for surely Mrs.
Fay and her sister had been kindness itself to
their young guests.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But goodness, gracious, Philip,&#8221; Patty exclaimed,
as they went flying down the road, &#8220;if
I had had to stay there another night, I should
have died!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Patty, it wasn&#8217;t so bad. Of course,
they are primitive and old-fashioned people;
but they are true ladies, even if not very highly
educated. And their hospitality was simply
unlimited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all that,&#8221; said Patty, impatiently;
&#8220;but I was bored to death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you didn&#8217;t show it; you were sweet as
a peach to those two people, and they&#8217;ll always
love you for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course I wouldn&#8217;t be impolite; but
I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re started for home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not. Patty, I just enjoyed every
minute,&mdash;because I was there with you. Dear,
you don&#8217;t <i>know</i> what it meant to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Philip,&#8221; and Patty turned to flash a
twinkling smile at him, &#8220;we have a twelve-mile
drive ahead of us, besides gathering the eggs.
Now, if you&#8217;re going to say things like that to
me all that twelve miles, I&#8217;m going to jump
right out into this snowbank and stay there till
somebody comes along and picks me up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Patty, I <i>must</i> say these things to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I <i>must</i> jump.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait a minute, dear; before you jump,
won&#8217;t you just tell me that I may have a little
hope that some day you&#8217;ll promise to be my own
little Patty forever?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip, I <i>can&#8217;t</i> say anything like that, and I
<i>wish</i> you wouldn&#8217;t tease me. If those snowbanks
didn&#8217;t look so dreadfully cold&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they <i>are</i> cold. If you don&#8217;t believe it,
I will wait while you try one. But, Patty, anyway,
tell me this. If I stop teasing you now,
will you give me an answer when I come back
at New Year&#8217;s? You know, I must take that
five-thirty train this afternoon, and I shan&#8217;t see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
you again till next week. Will you give me an
answer then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do!&#8217;&#8221;
sang Patty, with a saucy smile at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want Daisy&#8217;s answer, I want
yours. Now, you think it over through the
week, and when I come up next Tuesday, you
be ready to say, &#8216;Yes, Philip, you may hope,
and some day I&#8217;ll make your hope come true.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an awful long speech to learn by
heart,&#8221; said Patty, musingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you needn&#8217;t learn it word for word; just
say something from your own heart that means
the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;next Tuesday I&#8217;ll look
into my heart and see what&#8217;s there; and if there&#8217;s
anything for you, I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Philip was forced to be content with this,
for Patty suddenly changed the subject, and
began to chatter merry nonsense that afforded
no opportunity for romance. The roads were
only a little broken, and the going was hard,
because of occasional big drifts, but along some
wind-swept stretches they made fairly good
time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I say,&#8221; said Philip; &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to cut
out the butter and egg chapter! I simply <i>must</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
get that five-thirty, and I can&#8217;t do it if we go
around by Hatton&#8217;s Corners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; returned Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put it up
to Adèle that we just couldn&#8217;t do it; and I&#8217;ll
tell you what, Philip, we&#8217;ll go right to the station,
and you take the train there without going
to the Kenerleys&#8217; at all. They&#8217;ll send your
things down to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be the safer way. But how will
you get home from the station?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll telephone from the station office,
and they&#8217;ll send Martin, or somebody, after
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have to wait so long. Here&#8217;s a better
plan. Let&#8217;s stop at the Barclay Inn, and
telephone from there. Then when we reach
the station, Martin or somebody will be there
for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty agreed, and when they reached the Barclay
Inn, a few miles from Fern Falls, they
went in to telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on our way home,&#8221; said Patty, after
she had succeeded in getting a connection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should think it was time!&#8221; exclaimed
Adèle. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve missed!
Where are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At Barclay Inn; and we&#8217;re in an awful hurry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Philip is going to take the five-thirty from the
station, and you send somebody there to meet
me and drive the horses home, will you! And
what did I miss? And <i>you&#8217;ll</i> miss the butter
and eggs, because we didn&#8217;t get them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where have you been? We tried all
yesterday to get you on the telephone, and all
this morning, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; the wires broke down. But
everything&#8217;s all right. We stayed at Mrs. Fay&#8217;s.
I&#8217;ll tell you all about it when I see you. Be
sure to have me met at the station. Good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hung up the receiver and hurried back
to Philip. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to hustle to catch that
train,&#8221; he said, as he tucked her in the sleigh.
&#8220;Did you get Adèle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; she&#8217;ll send some one to meet me. She
says I missed something. Do you suppose they
had a party last night in all that blizzard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just as well for you to miss a party
once in a while; you have plenty of them. And
I like the party I was at better than any I ever
went to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The roads were much better where they were
travelling now, and they reached the station in
time for Philip&#8217;s train. But it was a close connection,
for the train was already in the station,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
and as Philip swung aboard, he saw Martin and
Hal Ferris coming in another sleigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There they are!&#8221; he called to Patty. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right, good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she called back, and then the
train pulled out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you <i>did</i> cut up a pretty trick!&#8221; exclaimed
Hal Ferris, as he came up to her.
&#8220;Now, you jump in here with me, and I&#8217;ll drive
you home, and let Martin look after your
horses. They must be pretty well done up. I
would have brought a motor, but the sleighing&#8217;s
fine, and the motoring isn&#8217;t. Hop in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hopped in, and in a moment they were
flying along toward home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I miss?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Did you
have a party last night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Party! in that storm! Rather not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what <i>did</i> I miss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think you missed anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Adèle told me so, over the telephone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, let Adèle tell you what it was.
How could I possibly know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did you do last night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much; sat around, sang a little, and
talked,&mdash;and I guess that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who was there? Didn&#8217;t Roger go home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Roger went down on the morning train,
just after you started on your wild career.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who <i>was</i> there? Chub, I know you&#8217;re
keeping something from me. Now, tell me
what it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really want to know, Patty? Well,
Bill Farnsworth was there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; and Patty nearly fell out of the
sleigh in astonishment. &#8220;Bill Farnsworth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he came unexpectedly yesterday afternoon.
Could only stay twenty-four hours, and
went back to-day on the two o&#8217;clock train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty wondered to herself why she felt as if
something awful had happened. She couldn&#8217;t
realise that Bill had been there, and had gone
away, and she hadn&#8217;t seen him! What a cruel
coincidence that it should have been just at the
time when she was away. But her pride came
to her rescue. She had no intention of letting
Hal Ferris or anybody else know that she cared.
</p>
<p>So she said, lightly: &#8220;Well, of all things!
Didn&#8217;t anybody expect him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; he thought he&#8217;d surprise us. He was
awfully cut up that you weren&#8217;t there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he was! Well, why didn&#8217;t you send
for me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Send for you! And you miles away, and a
blizzard blizzing like fury! But we spent
hours hanging over the telephone, trying to get
word to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wires were down,&#8221; said Patty, thinking
of the uninteresting evening she had spent,
when she might have been talking to Little
Billee.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They sure were! We tried and tried, but
we couldn&#8217;t get a peep out of you. Daisy said
it was because you were so wrapped up in Philip
that you wouldn&#8217;t answer the old telephone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s pretty face hardened a little as she
thought how Daisy would delight in making
such a speech as that before Farnsworth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Patty, are you cut up about this? Did
you want to see Big Bill, specially?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no,&#8221; said Patty, smiling again. &#8220;I
only thought it seemed funny that he happened
to come when I happened to be away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know; but of course nobody could
help it. He came East on a flying business
trip. Tried to get here for Christmas, but
couldn&#8217;t make it. He waited over a day, just
to skip up here and back; said he wanted to see
us all. But he had to take the two o&#8217;clock back
to New York to-day, and I believe he starts to-night
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
for Arizona. He&#8217;s a great fellow, Bill
is. You like him, don&#8217;t you, Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like him,&#8221; said Patty, simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known him for years, you know. Giant
Greatheart, we used to call him. So big and
good, you know. Always doing something for
somebody, and generous as he can be. Well,
he&#8217;s making good out in the mines. I don&#8217;t
know exactly what he&#8217;s doing, but he&#8217;s in a fair
way to be a rich man. He&#8217;s connected with
some big company, and he&#8217;s working with all
his might. And when you say that about Big
Bill Farnsworth, it means a good deal.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE COUNTRY CLUB BALL</h3>
</div>

<p>Before her mirror, Patty was putting
the last touches to her Bo-Peep costume,
and it must be confessed she was viewing
the effect with admiration.
</p>
<p>The gilt-framed glass gave back a lovely picture.
The costume was one of the prettiest
Patty had ever worn, and was exceedingly becoming.
There was a short, quilted skirt of
white satin and a panniered overdress of gay,
flowered silk, caught up with blue bows. A little
laced bodice and white chemisette completed
the dress. Then there was a broad-leafed
shepherdess hat, trimmed with flowers, and under
this Patty&#8217;s gold curls were bunched up on
either side and tied with blue ribbons. She
wore high-heeled, buckled slippers, and carried
a long, white crook, trimmed with blossoms and
fluttering ribbons.
</p>
<p>She pranced and turned in front of the mirror,
decidedly satisfied with the whole effect. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
she caught up her basket of flowers, which she
carried because it added a pretty touch, and
went downstairs.
</p>
<p>It was a gay-looking party that waited for her
in the hall. The two Misses Crosby had been
there to dinner, and also Mr. Hoyt and Mr.
Collins, and these, with the house party, were
now all arrayed in their fancy dress. As they
had agreed on Christmas Day, they were all in
pairs, and as of course there could be no secrecy
among them, they had not yet put on their
masks.
</p>
<p>Mona and Roger were very magnificent as
Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh.
Though Mona was not at all the type of the red-haired
queen, she looked very handsome in the
regal robes and great, flaring collar, while Roger
was a veritable courtier in his picturesque garb.
</p>
<p>Daisy and Mr. Collins were Pierrette and
Pierrot. Their costumes were black and white,
Frenchy-looking affairs, with tossing pompons
and peaked caps.
</p>
<p>The elder Miss Crosby and Jim Kenerley were
Indians; and the warlike brave and the young
Indian maiden looked as if they might have
stepped out of the earliest pages of our country&#8217;s
history.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>The other Miss Crosby and Hal Ferris were
Italian peasants in national costume.
</p>
<p>Adèle and Mr. Hoyt were the most simply
dressed of all, but in their plain Puritan garb
they were effective and distinguished looking.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, it was Philip Van Reypen
whose costume received the greatest applause.
He had copied a picture of Bobby Shafto that
had been painted by a frivolous-minded artist,
and his embroidered and belaced coat of light
blue silk was remindful of the period of the
gayest Louis. He wore white satin knee-breeches,
white silk stockings, and black slippers
with enormous buckles. In accordance with
the song, there were large silver buckles at his
knees; and his tri-corne hat was a very marvel
of gold lace and feathers. Full lace ruffles
flapped at his throat and wrists, and altogether
he was an absolute dandy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a valentine,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;or
a birthday cake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do look good enough to eat,&#8221; declared
Adèle, as she took in the gorgeous costume.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I flatter myself it&#8217;s the very last touch
of Shaftoism,&#8221; said Philip, strutting about with
an affected gait. &#8220;I say, Patty, you&#8217;re all kinds
of a peach yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this frock is all right,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but
you simply take my breath away, Phil. I
didn&#8217;t know anybody could look so beautiful!
I wish men dressed that way nowadays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then everybody admired everybody else
until it was time to start. Then each put on
a little mask, which they were to wear at the ball
until supper-time. Patty&#8217;s was of light blue
silk with a short fall of lace, and Philip&#8217;s was
of black satin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wear this thing all the way there,&#8221; declared
Patty, taking hers off again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, put it on just before you get there,&#8221;
enjoined Adèle. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken great care that
no one should know a word about our costumes,
and now if we are well masked they
won&#8217;t be able to guess who we are. Even
though they know we all came from our house,
there are so many of us, they can&#8217;t tell us apart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Country Club was a handsome, spacious
building, well away from the outskirts of the
town. But the motors took them there swiftly,
and soon they joined the large party of maskers
in the Club ballroom. There were perhaps a
hundred people there, and Patty felt there was
little risk of being recognised. She did not know
many of the Fern Falls people, anyway, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
they would scarcely know her in her disguise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the first dance is mine,&#8221; said
Philip, as the music began.
</p>
<p>But after that dance was over, Patty was besieged
by would-be partners. Historical characters,
foreigners, clowns, monks, and knights
in armour begged for dances with Little Bo-Peep.
Patty was so engrossed in looking at
these wonderful personages, that she scarcely
noticed who put their names on her card. And
in truth it made little difference, as none of the
men put their real names, and she hadn&#8217;t the
slightest idea who they were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourselves,&#8221; she said, laughing, &#8220;to
the dances before supper; but don&#8217;t touch the
other side of the card. After the masks are off,
I shall have some say, myself, as to my partners!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the first half of the dances were variously
signed for by Columbus and Aladdin and
Brother Sebastian and Jack Pudding and other
such names.
</p>
<p>During each dance Patty would try to discover
the identity of her partner, but as she only succeeded
in one or two cases, she gave it up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For it doesn&#8217;t make the slightest difference
who you are,&#8221; she said, as she danced with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
Brother Sebastian, who was garbed as a Friar
of Orders Grey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he returned, in a hollow, sepulchral
voice, which he seemed to think suited to his
monk&#8217;s attire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you needn&#8217;t try to disguise your voice
so desperately,&#8221; said Patty, laughing gaily, &#8220;for
probably I don&#8217;t know you, anyhow. And you
don&#8217;t know me, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know your name,&#8221; said the monk,
still in hollow tones, &#8220;but I know you&#8217;re a
dancer from the professional stage, and not just
a young woman in private life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; cried Patty, horrified.
&#8220;I&#8217;m nothing of the sort! I&#8217;m a simple-minded
little country girl, and I dance because
I can&#8217;t help it. I love to dance, but I must say
that a monk&#8217;s robe on one&#8217;s partner is a little
troublesome. I think all the time I&#8217;m going to
trip on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right; I&#8217;ll fix that,&#8221; said the monk,
and he held up the skirts of his long robe until
they cleared the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;but it does spoil
the picturesqueness of your costume. Let&#8217;s
promenade for a while, and then you can let
your robes drag in proper monkian fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged to you for not saying monkey
fashion! I certainly do feel foolish, dressed
up in this rig.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you ought not to, in that plain gown.
Just look at the things some of the men have
on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. Look at that court jester; he
must feel a fool!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s his part,&#8221; laughed Patty; &#8220;rather
clever, I think, to dress as a fool, and then if
you feel like a fool, you&#8217;re right in your part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Miss Bo-Peep, you&#8217;re clever, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so very; but when talking to a learned
monk, I try to be as wise as I can. Oh, look
at that stunning big man,&mdash;who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like one of the patriarchs; but I guess
he&#8217;s meant for King Lear. See the wreath of
flowers on his white hair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Lear wear flowers? I thought he wore
a crown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut! tut! Little Bo-Peep, you must brush up
your Shakespeare. Don&#8217;t you know King Lear
became a little troubled in his head, and adorned
himself with a garland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s awfully picturesque,&#8221; said Patty,
quite undisturbed by her ignorance of the play,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
and looking admiringly at Lear&#8217;s magnificent
court robes of velvet and ermine, and his long,
flowing white hair and beard, and the garland
of flowers that lay loosely on the glistening
white wig and trailed down behind.
</p>
<p>As they neared the picturesque figure, King
Lear bowed low before Patty, and held out his
hand for her dance card.
</p>
<p>It was the rule of the ball not to speak, but
to indicate invitations by gestures.
</p>
<p>However, Patty had no reason to keep silent,
as they were nearly all strangers, so she laughed,
and spoke right out: &#8220;I&#8217;d gladly give you a
dance, King Lear, but I haven&#8217;t one left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With another courtly bow, King Lear still
seemed to insist on his wish, and he took up her
card, which she had tied to her crook by a narrow
ribbon. With surprise he saw the whole
second page blank, and pointed to it with an
accusing gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; returned Patty, smiling, &#8220;but those
are for my friends after I know them. We unmask
at supper-time, and then I shall use some
discrimination in bestowing my dances. If you
want one of those you must ask me for it after
supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>King Lear bowed submissively to Patty&#8217;s decree,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
and was about to move away, when a sudden
thought struck him. He picked up Patty&#8217;s
card again, and indicated a space between the
last dance and the supper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you mean,&#8221; cried Patty.
&#8220;You mean an &#8216;extra.&#8217; But I don&#8217;t think
they&#8217;ll have any. And, anyway, I never engage
for extras. If they do have one, and you happen
to be around, I&#8217;ll give it to you;&mdash;that&#8217;s all
I can say.&#8221; And then Patty&#8217;s next partner came,
and she danced away with him, leaving King
Lear making his sweeping, impressive bows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221; asked Patty, of Roger, who
chanced to be her partner this time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure; but I know scarcely
any of the people up here. They seem to be a
fine crowd, though. Have you noticed the
Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra? There she is
now. Isn&#8217;t she stunning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked round, to see a tall, majestic
woman, dressed as Zenobia. Her tiny mask
hid only her eyes, and her beautiful, classic face
well accorded with the character she had chosen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s beautiful!&#8221; declared Patty, with heartfelt
admiration. &#8220;I wish I was big and stunning,
Roger, instead of a little scrap of humanity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a silly you are, Patty Pink! Now,
I&#8217;ve no doubt that tall, majestic-looking creature
wishes she could be a little fairy, like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a big woman is so much more graceful
and dignified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, I do believe you&#8217;re fishing! And I
<i>know</i> you&#8217;re talking nonsense! Dignified isn&#8217;t
just the term I should apply to you,&mdash;but if
there&#8217;s anybody more graceful than you are,
I&#8217;ve yet to see her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Roger, that&#8217;s dear of you. You know
very well, I hate flattery or compliments, but
when a real friend says a nice thing it does me
good. And, truly, it&#8217;s the regret of my life,
that I&#8217;m not about six inches taller. There,
look at Zenobia now. She&#8217;s walking with that
King Lear. Aren&#8217;t they a stunning couple?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are. But if I were you, I wouldn&#8217;t
be envious of other women&#8217;s attractions. You
have quite enough of your own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about me,&#8221; said Patty, suddenly
realising that she was talking foolishly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
talk about Mona. She&#8217;s looking beautiful to-night,
Roger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She always does,&#8221; and Roger had a strange
thrill in his voice, that struck a sympathetic
chord in Patty&#8217;s heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What about her, Roger? Isn&#8217;t she good to
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very. She&#8217;s capricious, Patty; sometimes
awfully kind, and then again she says
things that cut deep. Patty, do you think she
really cares for that Lansing man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Roger. I can&#8217;t make Mona
out at all, lately. She used to be so frank and
open with me, and now she never talks confidences
at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t understand her, either. But
here comes Mr. Collins, looking for you, Patty.
Is only half of this dance mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Roger. I had to chop up every one,
to-night. You may have one after supper, if
you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty whirled through the various dances, and
at the last one before supper she found herself
again with Philip Van Reypen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t know this was yours!&#8221; she
cried, looking at her card, where, sure enough,
she saw the initials B. S.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is mine,&#8221; returned Bobby Shafto;
&#8220;but we&#8217;re not going to dance it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, and what are we going to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to wander away into the conservatory.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any conservatory. This is a
club-house, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve fixed up the gymnasium, so
it&#8217;s almost a conservatory. It&#8217;s full of palms
and flowers and things, and it makes a perfectly
good imitation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why do we go there?&#8221; asked Patty, as
Philip led her away from the dancing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, to settle affairs of state.&#8221; He led her
to the gymnasium, and sure enough, tall palms
and flowering plants had been arranged to form
little nooks and bowers, which were evidently
intended for tête-à-tête conversations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; Philip began, as they found a
pleasant seat, under some palms, &#8220;you know,
Patty, you promised me something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t, neither.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you did, and I&#8217;m going to hold you to
your promise. You promised&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Rose, you promised!&#8217;&#8221; sang Patty, humming
a foolish little song that was an old-fashioned
favourite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you <i>did</i> promise, you exasperating little
Rose, you! And I&#8217;m going to keep you prisoner
here, until you make it good! Patty, you
said you&#8217;d look into your heart, and tell me
what you found there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me, Philip, did I really say that?
Well, it will take me an awful long while to tell
you all that&#8217;s in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Patty? Did you find so much?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, heaps of things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I mean about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, about you! Why, I don&#8217;t know that
there&#8217;s anything there at all about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there is; you can&#8217;t fool me that way.
Now, Patty, do be serious. Look in your heart,
and see if there isn&#8217;t a little love for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty sat very still, and closed her eyes, as
Philip could see through the holes in her blue
mask.
</p>
<p>Then she opened them, and said, with a smile:
&#8220;I looked and hunted good, Philip, and I can&#8217;t
find a bit of love for you. But there&#8217;s an awful
big, nice, warm friendship, if you care about
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do care about that, Patty. I care very
much for it, but I want more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just at that moment King Lear and Zenobia
strolled past them, and Patty almost forgot
Philip as she gazed after the two majestic figures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; he said, recalling her attention,
&#8220;Patty, dear, I say I want more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Piggy-wig!&#8221; exclaimed Patty, with her blue
eyes twinkling at him through the mask.
&#8220;More what? I was looking at King Lear,
and I lost the thread of your discourse, Philip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Fairfield, I&#8217;d like to shake you! Don&#8217;t
you <i>know</i> what I&#8217;m asking of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, even if I do, I must say, Philip, that I
can&#8217;t carry on a serious conversation with a mask
on. Now, you know, they take these things off
pretty soon, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then may I ask you again, Patty, and
will you listen to me and answer me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno. I make no promises. Philip, this
dance is over. I expect they&#8217;re going to unmask
now. Come on, let&#8217;s go back to our
crowd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But just as they rose to go, Jim Kenerley approached,
and King Lear was with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Bo-Peep,&#8221; said the big Indian, &#8220;King
Lear tells me that you half promised him an
extra, if there should be one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it was only half a promise, then it means
only half a dance,&#8221; said Patty, turning her
laughing blue eyes to the majestic, flower-crowned
King. &#8220;Is there going to be an extra,
Jim,&mdash;I mean Chief Mudjokivis, or whatever
your Indian name is?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Bo-Peep. I&#8217;ll go and see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim went away, and as Philip had already
gone, Patty was left alone with the white-haired
King.
</p>
<p>With a slow, majestic air, he touched her
gently on the arm, and motioned for her to be
seated. Then he sat down beside her, and
through the eyeholes of his mask, he looked
straight into her eyes.
</p>
<p>At his intent gaze, Patty felt almost frightened,
but as her eyes met his own, she became
conscious of something familiar in the blue eyes
that looked at her, and then she heard King
Lear whisper, softly: &#8220;Apple Blossom!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty fairly jumped; then, seeing the smile
that came into his eyes, she put out both hands
to King Lear, and said, gladly: &#8220;Bill! Little
Billee! Oh, I <i>am</i> glad to see you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you, really?&#8221; And Bill Farnsworth&#8217;s
voice had a slight tremor in it. &#8220;Are you sure
of that, my girl?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; and Patty had regained her
gay demeanour, which she had lost in her moment
of intense surprise. &#8220;Oh, of course I am!
I was so sorry to have missed you last week.
And Jim said you went back to Arizona.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did expect to, but I was detained in New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
York, and only this morning I found I could
run up here and stay till to-morrow. I couldn&#8217;t
get here earlier, and when I reached the house,
you had all started. So I got into these togs,
and came along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your togs are wonderful, Little Billee. I
never saw you look so stunning, not even as
Father Neptune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a great show, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; and Big
Bill smiled at the recollection. &#8220;But I say,
Little Girl, you&#8217;re looking rather wonderful
yourself to-night. Oh, Patty, it&#8217;s good to see
you again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s good to see you; though it doesn&#8217;t
seem as if I had really seen you. That mask
and beard completely cover up your noble countenance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I wish you&#8217;d take off that dinky little
scrap of blue, so I can see if you are still my
Apple Blossom Girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought you wanted the extra dance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s going to be any extra,
after all. I think the people are anxious to get
their masks off, and if so we&#8217;ll have our dance
after supper.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>BACK TO NEW YORK</h3>
</div>

<p>Farnsworth was right. There was no
extra before supper, and the guests were
even now flocking to the supper-room.
</p>
<p>Philip came toward them, looking for Patty,
his mask already off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can we really take them off now?&#8221; cried
Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad. They&#8217;re horridly uncomfortable.
I&#8217;ll never wear one again. I
love a fancy dress party, but I don&#8217;t see any
sense in a masquerade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took off her mask as she spoke, and her
pretty face was flushed pink and her hair was
curling in moist ringlets about her temples.
</p>
<p>Farnsworth looked down on her as he removed
his own mask. &#8220;Apple Blossom!&#8221; he exclaimed
again, and the comparison was very apt,
for the pink and white of Patty&#8217;s face was just
the color of the blossoms.
</p>
<p>Then the two men looked at each other, and
Patty suddenly realised that they had never met.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t know each other, do you?&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;And you my two best friends!
Mr. Farnsworth, this is Mr. Van Reypen. And
now, which of you is going to take me to supper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As each offered an arm at once, Patty accepted
both, and walked out demurely between
the two big men. The men were exceedingly
polite and courteous, but each was annoyed at
the other&#8217;s presence. As a matter of fact, Farnsworth
had chanced to overhear a few words
that Philip said to Patty a short time before.
It was by merest chance that King Lear and
Zenobia had walked by just as Philip was asking
Patty to give him more than friendship. Zenobia,
uninterested in the two under the palms,
didn&#8217;t even hear the words; but Farnsworth,
who had found out from Jim Kenerley all the
members of the house party, had scarcely taken
his eyes from Little Bo-Peep since he arrived
at the ball. With no intention of eavesdropping,
he had followed her about, hoping to get
a chance to see her first alone. He managed
this only with Kenerley&#8217;s help, and meantime he
had discovered that Van Reypen was very seriously
interested in Little Bo-Peep.
</p>
<p>Philip himself knew little of Farnsworth, save
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
for a few chance remarks he had heard at the
Kenerleys&#8217;, but he realised at once that Patty
and the big Westerner were great friends, if
nothing more.
</p>
<p>However, the three went to supper together,
and joined the group in which they were most
interested.
</p>
<p>Great was the surprise of Daisy and Mona
when Patty appeared with Mr. Farnsworth.
</p>
<p>Big Bill was in the merriest of spirits. He
greeted everybody heartily, he joked and
laughed, and was at his most entertaining best.
Patty was very proud of him, for without his
mask he looked very handsome as King Lear,
and his stalwart figure seemed to dwarf the
other men.
</p>
<p>After supper he claimed Patty for the promised
dance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you rather dance with King Lear?&#8221;
he said, smiling, &#8220;with all these heavy velvet
draperies bothering us, or shall I go and shed
this robe, and just be plain Bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at him, thoughtfully. &#8220;We&#8217;d
have a better dance if you took off that flapping
robe. But then, of course, you&#8217;d have to take
off your wigs and things, and you wouldn&#8217;t be
half so beautiful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, don&#8217;t let&#8217;s dance, but just stroll
around and talk. And there&#8217;s another reason
why I&#8217;d rather keep on my wig and wreath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the wreath means that I am mad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mad at me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not that kind of mad! I mean crazy,
demented, loony,&mdash;what was the old King, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little touched?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it; and so, you see, he could say
anything he wanted to. You know, people
forgive crazy people, no matter what they
say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to say crazy things to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely; you&#8217;ve completely turned my
head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, I didn&#8217;t even know King Lear
ever went crazy,&#8221; said Patty in an endeavour
to change the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, fie, fie, Little Girl, I thought you knew
your Shakespeare; but I suppose you&#8217;re too busy
socially to read much poetry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I read one poem this winter that I liked,&#8221;
said Patty, demurely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you? What was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It came to me in a blue envelope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It did! Why, Patty, Jim told me you never
got that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim is mistaken; I did get it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you like it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it, Bill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you like it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I liked it lots. Who wrote it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, really? You clever man! I
thought possibly you might have done it, but it
sounded so,&mdash;so finished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it didn&#8217;t, Patty. It was crude and
amateurish; but it was written to you and about
you, so I did the best I could. Patty, are you
in love with Van Reypen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; and Patty stood still and looked at
Farnsworth, indignantly. &#8220;You have no right
to ask such a question!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I haven&#8217;t, Patty, and I apologise. I
can&#8217;t seem to get over my Western bluntness.
And, Little Girl, I don&#8217;t blame you a bit if you
do care for him. He&#8217;s a good-looking chap,
and an all-round good man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have sized him up pretty
quickly. Why, you&#8217;ve only just met him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you know I was at the Kenerleys&#8217;
last week, and Jim told me all about him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you want to know all about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you why?&#8221; And Farnsworth&#8217;s
blue eyes looked straight into Patty&#8217;s own. &#8220;I
inquired about him, because Daisy said you were
just the same as engaged to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Daisy said that, did she?&#8221; Patty rarely
lost her temper, but this unwarranted speech of
Daisy Dow&#8217;s made her exceedingly angry. But
what hurt her even more, was that Bill should
believe Daisy&#8217;s assertion, and should take it so
calmly. His attitude piqued Patty; and she
said, coldly: &#8220;Well, if Daisy says so, it must
be so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, Little Girl,&#8221; and Farnsworth&#8217;s
voice was very tender. &#8220;He can give you
everything that you ought to have,&mdash;wealth,
social position, and a life of luxury and pleasure.
Moreover, he is a thorough gentleman and a
true man. I hope you will be very happy with
him, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some reason this speech exasperated
Patty beyond all measure. It seemed as if her
friends were settling her affairs for her, without
giving her any voice in the decision. &#8220;You are
a little premature, Bill,&#8221; she said, without a
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m not engaged to Mr. Van Reypen,
and I do not know that I shall be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will, Patty; but don&#8217;t be hasty,
dear child. Think it over before you decide,
for you know there are other things in the
world beside wealth and social position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What, for instance?&#8221; said Patty, in a flippant
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Love,&#8221; said Farnsworth, very seriously.
</p>
<p>And then Patty was moved by a spirit of perversity.
She thought that if Farnsworth really
cared for her, he was handing her over to Philip
very easily, and she resented this attitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you implying that Mr. Van Reypen is
not capable of giving me love, as well as the
other advantages you enumerate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Patty, I am not implying anything of
the sort. I only know that you are too young
yet to be engaged to anybody, and I wish for
your own sake you would wait,&mdash;at least until
you are perfectly sure of your own affections.
But if they are given to Mr. Van Reypen, I shall
be glad for you that you have chosen so wisely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty looked at Farnsworth in amazement.
Remembering what he had said to her last summer,
it was strange to hear him talk this way.
She could not know that the honest, big-hearted
fellow was breaking his own heart at the thought
of losing her; but that he unselfishly felt that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Van Reypen, as a man of the world, was more
fitting for pretty Patty than himself. He knew
he was Western, and different from Patty&#8217;s
friends and associates, and he was so lacking in
egotism or in self-conceit that he couldn&#8217;t recognise
his own sterling merits. And, too, though
he was interested in some mining projects, they
had not yet materialised, and he did not yet
know whether the near future would bring him
great wealth, or exactly the reverse of fortune.
</p>
<p>But Patty couldn&#8217;t read his heart, and she was
disappointed and piqued at his manner and
words. Without even a glance into his earnest
eyes, she said: &#8220;Thank you, Bill, for your advice;
I know it is well meant, and I appreciate it.
Please take me back to Philip now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farnsworth gave her a pained look, but without
a word turned and led her back to the group
they had left.
</p>
<p>Philip was waiting there, and Patty, to hide
the strange hurt she felt in her own heart, was
exceedingly kind in her manner toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our dance, Philip,&#8221; she said, gaily, and
though it hadn&#8217;t been engaged, Philip was only
too glad to get it.
</p>
<p>Soon afterward, the ball was over, and they
all went home. As Patty came from the cloak
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
room, wrapped in her fur coat, Philip stepped
up to her in such a possessive way, that Farnsworth,
who had also been waiting for her,
turned aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a foregone conclusion,&#8221; said Jim Kenerley
to Farnsworth, as he glanced at Patty and
Philip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Adèle. &#8220;Patty isn&#8217;t thinking
of conclusions yet. But I must say it would
be a very satisfactory match.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Van Reypen seems to be a fine fellow,&#8221;
agreed Farnsworth.
</p>
<p>When they reached home, Patty said good-night,
declaring she was weary enough to go
straight to bed at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come down again later, if you&#8217;re
hungry?&#8221; said Philip, smiling at the recollection
of Christmas Eve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and Patty flashed her dimples at him;
and knowing that Farnsworth was listening, she
added, &#8220;There&#8217;s no moonlight to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moonlight does help,&#8221; said Philip. &#8220;Good-night,
Little Bo-Peep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Bobby Shafto,&#8221; and Patty
started upstairs, then turned, and holding out
her hand to Farnsworth, said &#8220;Good-night,
King Lear; shall I see you in the morning?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; I leave on the early train,&#8221; said Farnsworth,
abruptly. &#8220;Good-night, Patty, and
good-bye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned away, toward Daisy, and Patty
went on upstairs.
</p>
<p>Farnsworth had spoken in a kind voice, but
Patty knew that he had heard what she and
Philip had said about coming down in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a horrid, mean old thing!&#8221; said
Patty to herself, when she reached her own
room. &#8220;His manners are not half as good as
Philip&#8217;s, and he&#8217;s rude and unkind, and I just
hate him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whereupon, as if to prove her words, she took
from her portfolio the poem in the blue envelope,
and read it all over again; and then put
it under her pillow and went to sleep.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A few days later Patty was back in New York.
She gave her father and Nan glowing accounts
of the delightful times she had had at Fern
Falls and the jollities of a country house party
in the winter time. She told them all about the
pleasant people she had met up there, about her
experience at Mrs. Fay&#8217;s, and about Farnsworth&#8217;s
flying visits.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to meet that man,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;I
think he sounds attractive, Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is attractive,&#8221; said Patty, frankly; &#8220;but
he&#8217;s queer. You never know what mood he&#8217;s
going to be in. Sometimes he&#8217;s awfully
friendly, and then again he gets huffy over nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you tease him, Patty,&#8221; said her
father, smiling at her. &#8220;You&#8217;re getting to be
such a popular young person that I fear you&#8217;re
getting spoiled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Patty,&#8221; said Nan, kindly. &#8220;Go ahead,
my child, and have all the fun you can. The
young men all adore you, and I don&#8217;t wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nancy Bell, how complimentary you
are!&#8221; and Patty gave her stepmother an affectionate
pat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; said Mr. Fairfield, &#8220;if I may have
the floor for a minute, I&#8217;d like to make an announcement.
We have a plan, Patty, which we
made while you were away, and which I hope
will meet with your approval.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As if I ever disapproved of any of your
plans, my dear daddy. Consider my approval
granted before you begin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s this: I think Nan is looking a
little bit pale, and I feel a trifle pale myself,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
so I think we two will run away down South
for a fortnight or so, and leave you here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; asked Patty, in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no; hardly that. But how would you
like to have Mrs. Allen, Nan&#8217;s mother, come
and stay with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that will be lovely,&#8221; exclaimed Patty.
&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully fond of Mrs. Allen, and I haven&#8217;t
seen her for a long time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not a very sedate matron,&#8221; said Nan,
laughing. &#8220;I dare say she&#8217;ll keep you on the
go, Patty. She&#8217;s fond of opera and concerts,
and she likes gaiety. But father will come
over for the week-ends, and look after you
both.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nan&#8217;s parents lived in Philadelphia, and as
they had just returned from a trip abroad, the
Fairfields hadn&#8217;t seen them lately. But it had
seemed to them that the arrangement they had
planned would be satisfactory all round, for
Mrs. Allen liked to spend a few weeks in New
York each winter.
</p>
<p>About a week later the elder Fairfields departed,
and Mrs. Allen arrived.
</p>
<p>She was a fine-looking lady of a youthful middle
age, and looked forward with pleasure to
her visit with Patty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you mustn&#8217;t let me be a burden to you
in any way, my dear,&#8221; Mrs. Allen said, after the
two were left alone. &#8220;Whenever I can help
you, or whenever you want a chaperon, I&#8217;m entirely
at your service; but when I&#8217;m not necessary
to your plans, don&#8217;t consider me at all,&mdash;and
don&#8217;t think about entertaining me, for I
can look after myself. I&#8217;m never lonely or
bored.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mrs. Allen,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure we shall get on most beautifully together,
and anything you want or want to do, I want
you to give your own orders, just as if you were
in your own home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so the two had many pleasant times together.
They went to matinées, teas, and concerts,
to picture exhibitions, and to card parties.
Mrs. Allen did not care for dances, but went
gladly when it was a party where Patty required
a chaperon.
</p>
<p>All of the young people liked Mrs. Allen, and
she became well acquainted with all of Patty&#8217;s
friends.
</p>
<p>Bill Farnsworth was still in New York. His
plans were uncertain, and often changed from
day to day, owing to various details of his business.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>He called on Patty occasionally, but not often,
and his calls were short and formal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like that big Western chap,&#8221; Mrs. Allen
said to Patty one day; &#8220;but he seems preoccupied.
Sometimes he sits as if in a brown study,
and says nothing for quite some minutes. And
then, when you speak to him, he answers
abruptly, as if bringing his mind back from faraway
thoughts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I daresay he&#8217;s very much wrapped up in his
business, Mrs. Allen,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;They say
he&#8217;s trying to swing a big mining proposition,&mdash;whatever
that means.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may mean a great many things,&#8221; said Mrs.
Allen, thoughtfully. &#8220;I hope he&#8217;s all right,
Patty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Big Bill Farnsworth all right?
Well, I rather guess he <i>is</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; and Mrs. Allen laughed.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t take up the cudgels so desperately.
I didn&#8217;t mean to accuse him of anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course you didn&#8217;t,&#8221; and Patty
laughed, too; &#8220;but whatever big Bill may lack
in the way of polish or culture, he&#8217;s absolutely
honest and honourable, even to an absurd degree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he lacks culture, Patty. His
manners are all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re all right, but he hasn&#8217;t quite the
correct ease of a man like Philip Van Reypen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, and I suppose it&#8217;s
the effect of the aristocratic Van Reypen ancestry.
But Mr. Farnsworth has such a splendid
big air of real nobility about him that I think
a more formal and conventional demeanour
would quite spoil him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it would,&#8221; said Patty, simply.
</p>
<p>That very afternoon Farnsworth came to call,
and told Patty he had come to say good-bye.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you think my farewells never mean
anything,&#8221; he said, smiling; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t wonder,
for I often say I am going, and then a
telegram obliges me to change my plan. But
I think it is positive this time that I shall leave
to-night for Arizona.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been successful in your undertakings?&#8221;
asked Patty, with a sympathetic interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe I have. I don&#8217;t want to be
over sanguine, and matters are not yet entirely
settled, but I think I have conquered the obstacles
which I came to conquer, and I hope
all will go well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, Little Billee,&#8221; said Patty, looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
at him with earnest good will. &#8220;I want you
to succeed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for that,&#8221; said Farnsworth, simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when are you coming East again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell; I may have to come back in February;
but if that is not necessary, I shall not
come for a year or more. You will be married
and settled by that time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I shan&#8217;t! In fact, I&#8217;ve about made
up my mind that I&#8217;ll never marry anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls have said that before, and been known
to change their minds. But whatever you do,
I wish you all happiness and joy throughout
your whole life,&mdash;Little Apple Blossom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farnsworth had risen to go, and he held
Patty&#8217;s hands in both his, as he looked straight
into her eyes.
</p>
<p>Patty&#8217;s own eyes fell beneath his gaze, and she
said, &#8220;And I wish you happiness wherever you
are, Little Billee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear,&#8221; he said, and then with a
final handclasp he went away.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>AN EXCITING CHASE</h3>
</div>

<p>Farnsworth had left Patty about two
o&#8217;clock, and it was only a few moments
later that her telephone rang.
</p>
<p>Her response was answered by a tearful, wailing
voice, that said, &#8220;Oh, Miss Patty, oh, <i>can&#8217;t</i>
you come here at once? Come right away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come where? Who are you?&#8221; said Patty,
bewildered, for she did not recognise the voice,
and it sounded like some one in deep distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t wait a <i>minute</i>! Every moment
is precious! Just come <i>at once</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can I come, if I don&#8217;t know who you
are? I can help you better, if you&#8217;ll control
yourself and tell me something about yourself
and your trouble. First of all, who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Anne, Miss Galbraith&#8217;s maid. You
know me, Miss Patty. Oh, come quick; Miss
Mona has gone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone! Where? Now, listen to me, Anne!
Stop your crying, and tell me what you mean,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
and then I will go to you at once. Where are
you? And where has Miss Mona gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in her apartment, and I don&#8217;t like to tell
you over the telephone where she&#8217;s gone. But,&mdash;Miss
Patty,&mdash;I think,&mdash;Oh, I fear,&mdash;she has
eloped with Mr. Lansing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last sentence came in an explosive burst,
as if the girl could keep her secret no longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Patty. And then, suddenly
realising that it was a desperate situation,
she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say another word, Anne! I
will go right straight to you. Stay there till
I come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew the excitable character of the girl,
and feared she might get hysterical if she talked
further over the telephone. Patty hung up the
receiver, and sat still for a moment, thinking
deeply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell Mrs. Allen,&#8221; she finally decided,
&#8220;but I must have some one to help me,&mdash;to go
with me. I believe I&#8217;ll call up Roger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she couldn&#8217;t bear to do that. It seemed
too dreadful to tell Roger what had happened.
She thought next of Kenneth, who was a standby
as a loyal friend, but he was far downtown
in his office, and might be busy with an important
case.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Philip, of course,&#8221; she said to herself; but
even with her hand on the receiver, another
thought flashed through her mind. &#8220;No one
could help me to save Mona like Big Bill!&#8221; she
thought, and on a sudden impulse she called up
his hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill,&mdash;it&#8217;s Patty,&#8221; she said, her voice trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; what is it? What is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The kind, quiet voice, with its deep tones of
sympathy and capability, made Patty realise that
she had appealed to the right one. &#8220;Oh, Bill,&#8221;
she went on, &#8220;there&#8217;s awful trouble, and you
must help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will, Little Girl! Steady now;
tell me what it&#8217;s all about. Do you want me
to come there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re just starting for the West,&#8221; cried
Patty, as she remembered this for the first time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter, if <i>you</i> want me. I&#8217;ll
be right over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And wait a minute; tell me what you think
we ought to do. I&#8217;ve heard from Anne that
Mona is eloping with that awful Lansing
man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no time to be lost! Take your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
little car, and go to The Plaza as fast as you
can spin! I&#8217;ll meet you there, in the Galbraiths&#8217;
apartment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bill hung up the receiver, without even a good-bye,
and Patty gave a little sigh of relief, for it
seemed as if he had taken the responsibility
from her shoulders, and would manage the matter
himself. She ordered her car, flung on her
hat and coat, and with a hasty word to Mrs.
Allen that she was going out, she drove her
little electric herself down to the hotel.
</p>
<p>When she entered the Galbraiths&#8217; apartment,
she found Farnsworth already there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; he said, looking at her with a
grave face. &#8220;That is, I think it must be.
Mona went away half an hour ago, and took
a suit case with her. She went in a motor with
Mr. Lansing. Anne is worried, because this
morning she overheard the two telephoning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t listening, Miss Patty,&#8221; said the tearful
maid. &#8220;That is, I didn&#8217;t mean to, but Miss
Mona was excited like, and her voice was so
loud I couldn&#8217;t help hearing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did, Anne,&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;it
may help us to save Miss Mona yet. What
else can you tell us?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, except that Miss Mona left a note
on her father&#8217;s desk, and I thought maybe it
might be to tell him she had gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Big Bill strode over to the desk, and there,
under a paperweight, lay a note, addressed to
Mr. Galbraith. He picked it up, and looked
at it, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t sealed. Considering
all things, I think it is our duty to read
it, but you know more about such matters than
I do. What do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty hesitated. She had always thought it
little less than a crime to read a note addressed
to another, but the circumstances made this case
seem an exception. &#8220;We might telephone to
Mr. Galbraith and ask his permission,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>But Big Bill seemed suddenly to have made
up his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he declared, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> take the responsibility
of this thing. To telephone would
frighten Mr. Galbraith, and would delay matters
too much, beside. I shall read this note,
and if I can&#8217;t square my action with Mr.
Galbraith afterward, I&#8217;ll accept the consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The impressive manner of the big man, his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
stern, set face, and honest, determined blue eyes
convinced Patty that he was right, and together
they read the note.
</p>
<p>In it, as they had feared, Mona told her
father that she was going away to marry Mr.
Lansing, because her father would not allow
her to marry him otherwise. She expressed
regret at the sorrow she knew this would bring
to her father, but she said she was old enough
to decide for herself whom she wished to marry,
and she felt sure that after it was over he would
forgive her, and call his two children back to
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mona never wrote that note of her own accord,&#8221;
exclaimed Patty, indignantly. &#8220;That
man made her do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he did!&#8221; agreed Bill, in a stern
voice. &#8220;I know Lansing,&mdash;and, Patty, the
man is a scoundrel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know him? I didn&#8217;t know you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do! And I ought to have warned
Mona more against him. I did tell her what
his real nature is, but she wouldn&#8217;t listen, and I
never dreamed she was so deeply infatuated
with him. But we mustn&#8217;t blame her, Patty.
She was simply under the influence of that man,
and he persuaded her to go with him against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
her better judgment. But we must go after
them and bring them back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going West to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless we rescue Mona first! Why,
Patty, she <i>mustn&#8217;t</i> be allowed to marry that
man! I tell you he&#8217;s a scoundrel, and I never
say <i>that</i> about a man unless I <i>know</i> it to be true.
But this is no time to discuss Lansing. We
must simply fly after them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you know where they&#8217;ve gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know! But we must find out, somehow.
Perhaps the men at the door can tell us.
Perhaps Anne can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know this, sir,&#8221; said Anne, who was
wringing her hands and weeping; &#8220;when Miss
Mona was telephoning, she said something
about Greenwich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; cried Bill. &#8220;That&#8217;s exactly
where they&#8217;d go! But wait, they would have
to go for a license first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Telephone the license man,&#8221; said Patty, inspired
by Bill&#8217;s manner and tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-O!&#8221; and after some rather troublesome
telephoning, Bill announced, &#8220;They did!
they got a license, and they started in a motor
for Greenwich about half an hour ago! Come
on, Patty! Anne, you stay right here, in case
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
we telephone. If Mr. Galbraith comes home,
don&#8217;t tell him a word about it. Leave it to me.
I&#8217;ll be responsible for this note.&#8221; Bill put the
note in his pocket, and almost pushing Patty out
of the door, he had her in the elevator and
downstairs almost before she knew it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we take my little car?&#8221; she asked, as
Bill strode through the lobby, and Patty hurried
to keep up with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, no! We want a racer. I&#8217;ll
drive it myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the power of sheer determination, the big
Western man procured a fast car in an incredibly
short time, and in a few moments he and
Patty were flying up Broadway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if you want to talk you may,&#8221; said Bill,
and his voice was quiet and composed, though
he was alertly threading his swift way through
the traffic. &#8220;I had to be a little short with you
while we were hurrying off, because I didn&#8217;t
want to lose a minute. But now, all I have to
do is to keep just inside the speed limit while
we&#8217;re in the city, and then I rather guess there&#8217;ll
be one big chase!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bill, you are just splendid!&#8221; exclaimed
Patty, with shining eyes, unable to repress her
admiration of his capability and strength.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t accomplished anything yet,
Patty; we&#8217;re only starting out to try. You
know, it&#8217;s a hundred to one shot that we miss
them,&mdash;for we&#8217;ve very little idea where they&#8217;ve
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a straight road to Greenwich.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they may have turned off anywhere.
They may change their minds a dozen times
about their destination.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Patty, positively; &#8220;not
unless they think they&#8217;re pursued, and of course
they&#8217;ve no idea of that. Speed her up, Bill;
the way is clear now! I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re
going at this pace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty, you&#8217;re a good pal! I don&#8217;t believe
any other girl would be as plucky as you are in
such a case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I haven&#8217;t done anything,&#8221; and Patty
opened her eyes wide, in surprise. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
done it all&mdash;Little Billee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve helped me more than you know.
With you by my side, I&#8217;m bound to succeed.&#8221;
Big Bill bent to his wheel, and the swift machine
flew along so fast that conversation became
impossible.
</p>
<p>As they neared Greenwich, Patty&#8217;s sharp eyes
descried a dark red car ahead of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s Mona&#8217;s
car! Chase &#8217;em, Bill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The nerve of him, to elope in her own car!&#8221;
growled Bill, through his clenched teeth. &#8220;I
told you he was a scoundrel, Patty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were rapidly gaining on the red car,
when, as it turned the corner, one of its occupants
saw their pursuers, and Patty heard a
shriek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mona&#8217;s yell,&#8221; she cried, in dismay.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve seen us, Bill, and now they&#8217;ll get
away from us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the pursuing car was swift, but
the big Galbraith car was a speed wonder, and
the elopers darted ahead with renewed determination
to escape capture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a shame!&#8221; wailed Patty. &#8220;They
recognised us, and now they&#8217;ll get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I know it!&#8221; and Farnsworth set his
teeth hard. &#8220;Sit tight, Patty; we&#8217;re going to
go faster!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t seem as if they could go any faster,
but they did, and if it had been anybody driving
except Farnsworth, Patty would have felt
frightened. But she knew his skill, and too,
she knew that he never let excitement or enthusiasm
run away with his judgment. So she sat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
as still as she could, striving to catch her breath
in the face of the wind; and refraining from
speech, lest she distract Bill&#8217;s attention even for
a second.
</p>
<p>At last, when they had a long, clear view
ahead, and they saw the red car ever increasing
the distance between them, Bill gave up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Patty; we can&#8217;t catch them! I&#8217;ve
done all I can, but that car they&#8217;re in is a world-beater!
They went through Greenwich like a
streak. They would have been arrested, but no
one could stop them. Oh, I say, My Little
Girl,&mdash;I have an idea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your idea faster than their car, Little
Billee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it is! Just you wait and see; Patty,
we&#8217;ve <i>got</i> &#8217;em!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farnsworth turned around and drove rapidly
back to Greenwich, which they had just passed
through.
</p>
<p>At a hotel there, he jumped out, told Patty to
wait, and rushed into the office.
</p>
<p>It was nearly ten minutes before he returned,
and Patty could scarcely believe that whatever
plan he had could be of any use after such
delay.
</p>
<p>He jumped in beside her, turned around, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
in a minute they were again whizzing along,
following the direction of the other car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I did, Patty,&#8221; he said,
chuckling. &#8220;I telephoned to the Stamford
Chief of Police, and asked him to arrest those
people for speeding as they crossed the city
limit!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they be speeding?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> they be speeding? You <i>bet</i> they will!
And even if they aren&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll be arrested, all
the same, and held without bail until we get
there! Oh, Patty, if the situation were not
so serious, I could laugh at this joke on Lansing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>On they went, at their highest speed, and
reached Stamford not very much later than the
red car they were following.
</p>
<p>At the city line, they found this car standing,
with two or three policemen forbidding its
further progress.
</p>
<p>Horace Lansing was in a violent fit of temper,
and was alternating bribes with threats of
vengeance, but the policemen were imperturbable,
having been told the facts of the case by
Farnsworth over the telephone.
</p>
<p>Mona was weeping bitterly, and though Patty
went to her with affectionate words, she stormed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
back, &#8220;Go away, Patty Fairfield! You have
no right to interfere in my affairs! It was your
prying that found this out. Go away; I won&#8217;t
speak to you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By what right have you followed us, Miss
Fairfield?&#8221; began Mr. Lansing, looking at
Patty, angrily.
</p>
<p>But Farnsworth strode over to the speaker,
and spoke to him, sternly but quietly. &#8220;Lansing,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s all up, and you know it!
Now, I don&#8217;t want to have a scene here and
now, so you have my permission to go away
wherever you like, on condition that you never
enter the presence again, of Miss Galbraith or
Miss Fairfield.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho!&#8221; said Lansing, with an attempt at
bravado. &#8220;You give me your permission, do
you? Let me tell you that Miss Galbraith is
my promised wife. We have the license, and
we&#8217;re about to be married. It will take more
than you to stop us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said Farnsworth, and putting his
hands in his pockets, he gave Lansing a contemptuous
glance. &#8220;Well, then, I shall have
to request assistance. If I tell this constable a
good reason why he should detain you long
enough to prevent your marriage to Miss Galbraith,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
would such an argument have any
weight with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an instantaneous change in Horace
Lansing&#8217;s demeanour. From a blustering braggart,
he became a pale and cringing coward.
But with a desperate attempt to bluff it out, he
exclaimed, &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; but even
as he spoke, he shivered and staggered backward,
as if dreading a blow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you ask me,&#8221; said Farnsworth, looking
at him, sternly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer frankly, that unless
you consent to go away and never again enter
the presence of these ladies, I shall inform these
policemen of a certain little bank trouble that
happened in Chicago&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was unnecessary to go on. Lansing was
abject, and begged in pleading tones that Farnsworth
would say no more. &#8220;I am going,&#8221;
Lansing stammered, and without a word of
farewell to Mona or even a glance at Patty, he
walked rapidly away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; said Farnsworth. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
tell you girls about it, but I&#8217;ll explain to Mr.
Galbraith. Mona, that man is not fit for you
to know! He is guilty of forgery and robbery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; declared Mona, angrily.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>do</i> believe it,&#8221; and Farnsworth looked
at her steadily, &#8220;because you know I would not
tell you so unless I knew it to be true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mona was silent at this, for she did know it.
She knew Bill Farnsworth well enough to know
that if he made an accusation of that sort, he
knew it to be the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I love him so,&#8221; she said, sobbing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mona, you don&#8217;t love him.&#8221; Bill spoke
very gently, and as he laid his hand on Mona&#8217;s
shoulder, she raised her eyes to look into his
kind, serious face. &#8220;You were not much to
blame, Mona; the man fascinated you, and you
thought the foolish infatuation you felt for him
was love. But it wasn&#8217;t, and you&#8217;ll soon forget
him. You don&#8217;t want to remember a man who
was a wrong-doer, I&#8217;m sure; nor do you want
to remember a man who goes away and deserts
you because he has been found out. Mona, is
not his going away as he did, enough proof of
his guilt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Mona was sobbing so that she could not
speak. Not angry sobs now, but pathetic, repentant
sorrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, it&#8217;s up to you, Patty,&#8221; said Farnsworth,
cheerily. &#8220;You and Mona get into the
tonneau of this Galbraith car, and I&#8217;ll drive you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
home. You chirk her up, Patty, and tell her
there&#8217;s no harm done, and that all her friends
love her just the same. And tell her if she&#8217;ll
stop her crying and calm herself before she gets
home, nobody need ever know a thing about
this whole affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mona looked up at this, and said, eagerly,
&#8220;Not father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mona dear,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Sit here by
me and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it. How we read
the note and kept it, and everything. And,
Mona, we won&#8217;t even let Roger know anything
about all this, because it would hurt him very
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Anne,&#8221; said Mona, doubtfully. &#8220;You
say she told you where I went.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to Anne,&#8221; said Farnsworth, decidedly.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you go home to dinner with
Patty, Mona? I think that would do you
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;And stay over night
with me. We&#8217;ll telephone your father where
you are, and then, to-morrow, you can go home
as if nothing had ever happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a justifiable deception, Mona,&#8221; said Bill,
&#8220;for I know how it would grieve the poor man
if he knew about your foolish little escapade,&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
is all over now. It&#8217;s past history, and
the incident is closed forever. Don&#8217;t you be
afraid Lansing will ever appear against you.
He&#8217;s too thoroughly frightened ever to be seen
in these parts again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You come to dinner, too, Bill,&#8221; said Patty,
as they took their places; &#8220;though I fear we&#8217;ll
all be rather late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Farnsworth hesitated a moment, then he said,
decidedly, &#8220;No, Patty, I can&#8217;t do it. I was to
take the seven o&#8217;clock train to-night, but though
I&#8217;ll miss that, I can take the nine o&#8217;clock, and
I <i>must</i> go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Little Billee, I want to thank you for
helping me as you did. I want to thank you,
not only for Mona&#8217;s sake, but my own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be worth staying for, Little Girl,
but it is a case of duty, you see. Won&#8217;t you
write me your thanks,&mdash;Apple Blossom?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Patty, softly, &#8220;I will.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>BRIDESMAID PATTY</h3>

<p>Early in February Christine was to be
married, and the Fairfields had persuaded
her to accept the use of their
house for the occasion.
</p>
<p>Christine had demurred, for she wanted a simple
ceremony with no reception at all. But the
Fairfields finally made her see that Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s
position as an artist of high repute made
it desirable that his many friends should be invited
to his wedding.
</p>
<p>So Christine agreed to the plan, and Patty was
delighted at the thought of the festivities in
her home.
</p>
<p>The elder Fairfields had returned from their
Southern trip, but Mrs. Allen was still with
them, and there were other house guests from
Christine&#8217;s Southern home.
</p>
<p>The day of the wedding, Patty, assisted by
Elise and Mona, was superintending the decorations.
Christine had insisted that these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
should be simple, and as Mr. Hepworth, too,
was opposed to the conventional work of a
florist, the girls had directed it all themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does look perfectly sweet,&#8221; said Patty, as
she surveyed the drawing-room. &#8220;Personally,
I should prefer all those dinky white telegraph
poles stretched with ribbon and bunched up with
flowers to make an aisle for the happy couple
to walk through. But as it isn&#8217;t my wedding,
I suppose we must let the bride have her own
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of those tied up poles,&#8221; said Elise,
decidedly. &#8220;I think this is a lot prettier, and
all this Southern jasmine is beautiful, and just
like Christine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the sweetest thing!&#8221; said Patty.
&#8220;Every new present that comes in, she sits and
looks at it helplessly, as if it were the very last
straw!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, most of the presents are
from Mr. Hepworth&#8217;s friends,&#8221; said Mona,
&#8220;and they are stunning! I don&#8217;t wonder
Christine is overcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has lots of friends of her own, too,&#8221;
said Patty. &#8220;All the girls gave her beautiful
things, and you two quite outdid yourselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
That lamp of yours, Mona, is a perfect dream;
and, Elise, I never saw such gems as your silver
candlesticks. Christine&#8217;s path through life will
be well lighted! Well, everything&#8217;s finished,
and I think it&#8217;s about time we went to dress.
The ceremony&#8217;s at four, and as I&#8217;m going
to be a bridesmaid for the first time in my
mad career, I don&#8217;t want to be late at the
party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautiful the drawing-room looks,&#8221;
said Mrs. Allen, coming along just then.
&#8220;Patty dear, doesn&#8217;t this all remind you of the
day Nan was married?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Allen; only the weddings are
quite different. But Christine would keep this
as simple as possible, so of course I let her have
her own way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Patty, that&#8217;s the privilege of a bride.
But some day you can have your own way in
the direction of your own wedding, and I
rather fancy it will be an elaborate affair. I
hope I&#8217;ll be here to see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will, Mrs. Allen,&#8221; laughed Patty;
&#8220;but don&#8217;t look for it very soon. My suitors
are so bashful, you know; I have to urge them
on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Elise. &#8220;Patty&#8217;s greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
trouble is to keep her suitors off! She tries to
hold them at arm&#8217;s length, but they are so insistent
that it is difficult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you girls are all too young to have
suitors,&#8221; commented Mrs. Allen, smiling at
the pretty trio.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Allen,&#8221; said Patty; &#8220;suitors
doesn&#8217;t mean men who want to marry you. I
suppose it&#8217;s sort of slang, but nowadays, girls
call all their young men suitors, even the merest
casual acquaintances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Mrs. Allen. &#8220;I suppose
as in my younger days we used to call them
beaux.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just that,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;Why, Mr.
Hepworth used to be one of our favourite
suitors, until he persuaded Christine to marry
him; but we have lots of them left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that big one coming to the wedding?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Allen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She means Bill Farnsworth,&#8221; said Patty to
the others. &#8220;She always calls him &#8216;that big
one.&#8217; I don&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s coming or
not. He said if he possibly could get here,
he would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come,&#8221; said Elise, wagging her head,
sagely. &#8220;He&#8217;ll manage it somehow. Why,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
Mrs. Allen, he worships the ground Patty
walks on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do all my suitors,&#8221; said Patty, complacently.
&#8220;They&#8217;re awful ground worshippers,
the whole lot of them! But so long as they
don&#8217;t worship me, they may adore the ground
as much as they like. Now, you people must
excuse me, for I&#8217;m going to get into that flummery
bridesmaid&#8217;s frock,&mdash;and I can tell you,
though it looks so simple, it&#8217;s fearfully and
wonderfully made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty ran away to her own room, but paused
on the way to speak to Christine, who
was already being dressed in her bridal
robes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>sweet</i> thing!&#8221; cried Patty, flinging her
arms round her friend&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Christine
dear, you know I&#8217;m not much good at sentimental
expressions, but I <i>do</i> want to wish you
such a heap of joy that you&#8217;ll just almost break
down under it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine smiled back into Patty&#8217;s honest eyes,
and realised the loving friendship that
prompted the words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t begin to thank you
for all you&#8217;ve done for me this past year, but
I thank you most,&#8221;&mdash;here she blushed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
whispered shyly,&mdash;&#8220;because you didn&#8217;t want
him, yourself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christine!&#8221; said Patty, &#8220;I <i>do</i> want
him, something dreadful! I shall just <i>pine</i>
away the rest of my sad life because I can&#8217;t
have him! But you wrested him from me,
and I give him to you with my blessing!&#8221;
And then Patty went away, and Christine
smiled, knowing that Patty&#8217;s words were merely
jesting, and knowing too, with a heart full of
content, that Gilbert Hepworth really wanted
<i>her</i>, and not the radiant, mischievous Patty.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Promptly at four o&#8217;clock, the old, well-known
music sounded forth, and Patty came slowly
downstairs. Her gown was of white chiffon,
over pink chiffon, and fell in soft, shimmering
draperies, that looked like classic simplicity, but
were in reality rather complicated. Christine
had designed both their gowns, and they were
marvels of beauty. On Patty&#8217;s head was
perched a coquettish little cap of the style most
approved for bridesmaids, and she carried a
clustered spray of pink roses. As she entered
the drawing-room, intent on walking correctly
in time to the music, she chanced to glance up,
and saw Bill Farnsworth&#8217;s blue eyes fixed upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
her. Unthinkingly, she gave him a radiant
smile, and then, with the pink in her cheeks
deepened a little, she went on her way toward
the group of palms, where the wedding party
would stand.
</p>
<p>Not even the bride herself looked prettier
than Patty; though Christine was very sweet,
in her soft white chiffon, her misty veil, and
her shower bouquet of white flowers, which she
had expressly requested should be without ribbons.
</p>
<p>Only the more intimate friends had been invited
to the ceremony, but immediately after,
the house was filled with the reception guests.
Patty was in gay spirits, which was not at all
unusual for that young woman. She fluttered
about everywhere, like a big pink butterfly, but
ever and again hovering back to Christine, to
caress her, and, as she expressed it, &#8220;To keep
up her drooping spirits.&#8221; Christine had never
entirely overcome her natural shyness, and being
the centre of attraction on this occasion
greatly embarrassed her, and she was glad of
Patty&#8217;s gay nonsense to distract attention from
herself.
</p>
<p>Kenneth Harper was best man, and, as he told
Patty, the responsibility of the whole affair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
rested on himself and her. &#8220;We&#8217;re really of
far greater importance than the bride and
groom,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and they depend on us for
everything. Have you the confetti all ready,
Patty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course; do you have to go to the
train with them, Ken?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; my duties are ended when I once get
them packed into a motor at the door. But
Christine looks as if she couldn&#8217;t survive much
longer, and as for old Gilbert, he&#8217;s as absent-minded
as the conventional bridegroom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Patty. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to take her off, now, to get into her travelling
clothes. Oh, Ken, she has the loveliest
suit! Sort of a taupe colour, you know, and
the dearest hat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty! Do you suppose I care what she&#8217;s
going to wear away? But <i>do</i> see to it that
she&#8217;s ready on time! You girls will all get to
weeping,&mdash;that&#8217;s the way they always do,&mdash;and
you&#8217;ll spin out your farewells so that they&#8217;ll
lose their train! Run along with Christine,
now; Hepworth is fidgeting like the dickens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the pretty bridesmaid took the pretty bride
away, and Patty begged Christine to make haste
with her dressing, lest she might lose the train.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Hepworth will go away without
you,&#8221; Patty threatened. &#8220;Now, you do always
dawdle, Christine; but this time you&#8217;ve
got to hustle,&mdash;so be spry,&mdash;Mrs. Hepworth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Christine smiled at Patty&#8217;s use of the new
name, and she tried to make the haste Patty
demanded. But she was slow by nature, and
Patty danced around her in terror, lest she
should really be late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your coat, Christine,&mdash;put your arms
in, do! Now the other one. Now sit down,
and I&#8217;ll put your hat on for you. Oh, Mrs.
Hepworth, <i>do</i> hold your head still! Here,
stick this pin in yourself, or I may jab it
through your brain,&mdash;though I must confess
you act as if you hadn&#8217;t any! or if you have, it&#8217;s
addled. And Ken says that husband of yours
is acting just the same way. My! it&#8217;s lucky
you two infants had a capable and clever bridesmaid
and best man to get you off! There!
take your gloves,&mdash;no, don&#8217;t hold them like
that! put them on. Wake up, Christine; remember,
the show isn&#8217;t over yet. You&#8217;ve got
to go downstairs, and be showered with confetti,
and, oh, Christine, <i>don&#8217;t</i> forget to throw
your bouquet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221; and Christine Hepworth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
woke up suddenly from her dreaming, and
clasped her bridal bouquet to her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! of course you will! You&#8217;ve simply
<i>got</i> to! I&#8217;m not going to run this whole
wedding, and then have the prima donna balk
in the last act. Now, listen, Christine, you
throw it over the banister just as you start
downstairs! Will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the meek response; &#8220;I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And wait a minute; don&#8217;t you throw it till
I get down there myself, for I might catch
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do catch it, Patty, and then you can give
it back to me. I want to keep it all my
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t, Christine; it isn&#8217;t done!
You&#8217;ll have to direct your sentimentality in
some other direction. Or, here, I&#8217;ll give you
a flower out of it, and that&#8217;s plenty for you to
keep for a souvenir of this happy occasion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I have to throw it, anyway?&#8221; persisted
Christine, as she tucked the flower away
for safe keeping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, because I tell you to!
and, incidentally, because it&#8217;s the custom. You
know, whoever catches it will be married inside
of a year. Now, I&#8217;m going on down, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
you come along with Nan, and I expect you&#8217;ll
find Mr. Hepworth down there somewhere,&mdash;if
Ken hasn&#8217;t lost him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty cast a final critical glance at Christine,
and seeing that she was all right in every respect,
she gave her one last kiss, and hurried
downstairs. She found a group of laughing
young people standing in the hall, all provided
with confetti, and the girls all looking upward
to watch for the descending bouquet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a good place for you, Patty Pink and
White,&#8221; and Farnsworth guided her to a place
directly under the banister.
</p>
<p>At that moment Christine appeared at the
head of the stairs. She stood a moment, her
bouquet held at arm&#8217;s length, and looked at it
as if she couldn&#8217;t quite bring herself to part
with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, <i>now</i> she&#8217;s going to toss it! <i>Quick</i>,
Patty, catch it!&#8221; Big Bill whispered in her ear,
and Patty looked upward. Then, seeing the
direction in which the flowers fell,&mdash;for Christine
really tossed them straight at her,&mdash;Patty
whirled round and sprang aside, so that the
bouquet was picked up by a girl who stood next
to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Patty! you muffed it!&#8221; cried Farnsworth;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
&#8220;and what&#8217;s more, you did it on purpose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course I did!&#8221; declared Patty. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to be married this year, thank you. But
it was all I could do to dodge it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then the confetti was showered on the
departing couple, Kenneth tucked them into the
motor car, Patty jumped in too, for a last rapturous
hug of Christine, and Kenneth almost
had to pull her out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come, Patty,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Let them
make their getaway! I think they&#8217;ve missed
the train as it is. There, now, they&#8217;re off!
My, a best man&#8217;s lot is not a happy one! But
our trials are over now, Patty girl, and we can
take a little rest! Let&#8217;s go back and receive
the congratulations of the audience on our
good work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to the house, laughing, and
Patty succeeded in obtaining a few more blossoms
from the bridal bouquet to save for Christine
until she came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you catch it, Patty?&#8221; said Kenneth.
&#8220;Do you want to be an old maid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nobody asked me, sir, she said,&#8217;&#8221; and
Patty dropped her eyes, demurely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean there&#8217;s nobody that hasn&#8217;t asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
you!&#8221; returned Kenneth. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask
you, myself, some day; but not to-night. I&#8217;ve
had enough to do with matrimonial alliances
for one day!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; laughed Patty. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put it
off for a year, Ken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was the laughing response, and
then they rejoined the other young people.
</p>
<p>After the reception was over, a few of Patty&#8217;s
more intimate friends were invited to remain
to dinner with the Fairfields.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you stay, Little Billee?&#8221; asked Patty,
dancing up to him, as he seemed about to
leave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to take a midnight train,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I have some business matters that I must
attend to first. So if I may, I&#8217;ll run away now,
and come back this evening for a dance with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; be sure to come,&#8221; and Patty
flashed him a smiling glance, and danced away
again.
</p>
<p>It was after eleven before Farnsworth returned,
and Patty had begun to fear he would
not come at all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221; asked Philip
Van Reypen, as Patty continued to glance over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
her shoulder toward the hall, while they were
dancing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; was the non-committal answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, you may as well look at me.
At least, I&#8217;m better than nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Much</i> better!&#8221; said Patty, with exaggerated
emphasis; &#8220;<i>ever</i> so much better! Oh, say,
Philip, take me over to the hall, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? This dance has just begun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind!&#8221; said Patty, impatiently.
&#8220;Lead me over that way!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Patty turned her own dancing steps in that
direction, and when they reached the hall,
there was Big Bill Farnsworth, smiling at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I was looking for!&#8221; said Patty,
gaily. &#8220;Run away now, Philip. Little Billee
can only stay a minute, and we&#8217;ll finish our
dance afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Van Reypen was decidedly annoyed, but he
didn&#8217;t show it, for he knew Patty&#8217;s caprices
must be obeyed. So he bowed politely, and
walked away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mad as hops,&#8221; said Patty, calmly; &#8220;but
I had to see you for a few minutes, if you&#8217;re
really going on that midnight train. Are you,
Little Billee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Apple Blossom, I am. I&#8217;ve time for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
just one turn round the room. Will you
dance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For answer, Patty put her hand in his, and
they waltzed slowly round the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the busiest business man I ever
saw,&#8221; Patty said, pouting a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>am</i> very busy just now. Indeed, matters
are rapidly coming to a crisis. It was only
because I suddenly found that I must be in Boston
to-morrow, that I could stop here to-day.
And if matters turn out to-morrow as I hope
they will, I must start back immediately to Arizona.
But some day I hope to be less hurried,
and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; asked Patty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I hope to live in New York, and learn
good manners and correct customs, and make
myself fit to be a friend of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Little Billee, you <i>are</i> a friend of mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, something more than a friend, then.
Patty,&mdash;I <i>must</i> ask you,&mdash;are you engaged to
Van Reypen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, no!&#8221; and Patty flashed a glance
of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Patty, mayn&#8217;t <i>I</i> hope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a question I <i>never</i> know how to answer,&#8221;
said Patty, demurely; &#8220;if you mean that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
I&#8217;m to consider myself bound by any sort of a
promise, I most certainly won&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean that, dear, but,&mdash;&mdash;well,
Patty, won&#8217;t you wait?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll wait. That&#8217;s exactly what I
mean to do for years and years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to,&mdash;but you&#8217;re so capricious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! not <i>that</i>, of all things! And, anyway,
what does capricious mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it means like a butterfly, hovering
from one flower to another&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you think you&#8217;re like unto a flower?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be any kind of a flower you wish, if you&#8217;ll
hover around me like a butterfly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be a timid little forget-me-not,&mdash;that
will be lovely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll forget-you-not, all right; but I can&#8217;t be
timid, it isn&#8217;t my nature.&#8221; And now they had
stopped dancing, and stood in the hall, near
the door, for it was almost time for Farnsworth
to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m timid,&#8221; and the six feet
three of humanity towered above her, &#8220;that I
don&#8217;t grab you up and run away with you, but
because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, because what?&#8221; said Patty, daringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, Apple Blossom,&#8221; and Bill spoke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
slowly, &#8220;when I see you here in your rightful
setting, and surrounded by your own sort of
people, I realise that I&#8217;m only a great, big&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear,&#8221; interrupted Patty. &#8220;You <i>are</i> like
a big bear, Bill! But such a nice, gruff, kind,
woolly bear,&mdash;and the best friend a girl ever
had. But I wish you&#8217;d be more of a chum,
Little Billee. I like to be good chums with
every one of my suitors! It&#8217;s all very well for
Christine to marry; she doesn&#8217;t care for society,
she just only loves Mr. Hepworth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day you&#8217;ll forget your love for society,
because you&#8217;ll get to love just only one man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And it might as well be you,&#8217;&#8221; hummed
Patty, to an old tune.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty!&#8221; cried Farnsworth, his blue eyes
lighting up with sudden joy; &#8220;do you mean
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, <i>I</i> never mean anything! Of <i>course</i>, I
don&#8217;t mean it,&mdash;but if I <i>did</i>, I&#8217;d say I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patty Pink and White! you little scamp! if
you tease me like this, how do you suppose I&#8217;m
ever going to tear myself away to catch that
midnight train to Boston?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you can&#8217;t get that, Little Billee! it&#8217;s
too late, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t; and beside, I <i>must</i> make it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
He looked at his watch. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just exactly
two minutes longer to stay with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two minutes is a long time,&#8221; said Patty,
flippantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is! it&#8217;s just long enough for two
things I have to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you to do?&#8221; asked Patty, wonderingly,
looking up at him, as they stood alone
in the hall.
</p>
<p>Farnsworth&#8217;s strong face wore a determined
look, but his blue eyes were full of a tender
light, as he answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two very important things,&mdash;Apple Blossom,&mdash;this,&mdash;and
this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He kissed her swiftly on one pink cheek and
then on the other, and then, like a flash, he was
gone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Patty, softly, to herself, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
